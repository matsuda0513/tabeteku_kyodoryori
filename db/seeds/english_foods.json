    "history": "\"Abekawa Mochi\" is a regional dish in the Chubu region, with Shizuoka City at its center. It consists of freshly made mochi (rice cakes) coated with kinako (roasted soybean flour) mixed with sugar. The name \"Abekawa Mochi\" is derived from the Abekawa River that flows through the prefecture. There are two theories about the origin of the name: one suggests that it was named by Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Edo period, and the other claims that it became famous as a specialty sold at the Abekawa River teahouses among travelers on the Tokaido highway.Even in the present day, at the foot of the Abekawa Bridge, there are shops offering Abekawa Mochi, with some establishments boasting a history of over 200 years. This treat also makes an appearance in the travelogue \"Tokaido-chu Hizakurige\" written by Jippensha Ikku during the Edo period.",

    "prefecture": "Miyagi Prefecture",
    "history": "In Obon holidays (mid-August), tofu merchants worked hard making fried thin tofu and fresh tofu for \"Shojin ryori (vegan cuisine for Buddist monks)\". However, they always faced a big issue; both fried and non-fried tofu were spoiled quickly because there wasn’t any refrigeration technology like we have today. In such circumstances, a tofu shop in Tome City thought of “Aburafu”.When wheat flour and water are mixed well together and rinse the starch with water, gluten stays there.There are three types of “Fu” = wheat gluten: \"Namafu\", \"Yakifu\", and \"Aburafu\". \"Namafu\" is steamed gluten combined with glutinous rice flour, while \"Yakifu\" is baked one with wheat flour. Like \"Yakifu\", aburafu is made by adding wheat flour to gluten, and shaped into sticks and fried. Because it has a great flavor and a chewy texture, it is also used in vegetarian or macrobiotic cuisine. \"Aburafu\" was produced only in the Tome region before, but it’s widely manufactured outside of Tome area since \"Aburafu\" has been getting popular nationally. \"Aburafudon (Rice Bowl with deep-fried wheat gluten)\" is a famous dish made with \"Aburafu\" and was made up by the hostess of a local inn. It’s like a katsudon with replacing the pork cutlet with \"Aburafu\", and the flavor of \"Aburafu\" is brought out to its fullest. It is getting well-known nationwide after participating in the local food competition called “B-1 Grand Prix.”",

    "history": "The origin of \"Aburage-zushi(Inari-zushi)\" is a matter of some debate, but it is said to have originated when rice was stuffed into fried thin tofu that had been offered to \"Inari-san\" and made into a sushi. There are also various theories as to where it originated, and the town in front of \"Toyokawa Inari Shrine\", one of the three major Inari shrines in Japan, along with Edo and Nagoya, is said to be the birthplace of the dish. \"Aburage-zushi(Inari-zushi)\" is said to have been invented at \"Toyokawa Inari Shrine\" in the latter half of the Edo period (1603-1867).Nagoya's \"Aburage-zushi\" is characterized by the fact that it is filled with sweet and spicy fried thin tofu and \"sushi rice(=vinegared rice)\", and the bottom is not closed. It is said that Nagoya was the first place to call the combination of “Aburage-zushi\" and “Makizushi\" “Sukeroku\". There is a theory that the name \"Sukeroku\" comes from the main character in the Kabuki play \"Sukeroku Yukari no Edozakura (Sukeroku's Relation to Edo Cherry Blossoms)\" (18 plays). The name of Sukeroku's mistress, “Age-maki\", may have been taken from the word \"Age\" and likened to \"Aburage-zushi\", which is made of fried thin tofu, and the fact that “Sukeroku\" came wearing a \"Hachimaki (a type of sushi roll)\" may have been compared to “Maki-zushi\", It is said that “Sukeroku\" may have compared it to “Maki-zushi\" since he had rolled it up.In the town in front of \"Toyokawa Inari Shrine\", “Inari-zushi\" has long been sold and served to visitors to the shrine. The standard “Inari-zushi\" made of fried thin tofu in “Dashi (=Japanese soup stock)\" and \"sushi rice(=vinegared rice) is popular, but many stores also offer creative “Aburage-zushi\" as part of their efforts to revitalize the town.",

There is a theory that it was brought from Satsuma during the rule of the Satsuma domain and became popular in the Amami region because it is a dried noodle that can be preserved, but this is not certain.

It is characterized by the aroma of the skin and scales and the slight bitterness of the liver. The damselfish is a small fish with a body length of about 10 cm and is found widely in the Sea of Japan. There are few regions that actively eat it because it has many small bones and a thin body. In some regions, it was called “kajikiri” because it was so prolific that it interfered with the movement of ships when it was in season and was not welcomed very much. The Genkai Sea, which is close to Hakata Bay, has long been a good fishing ground where the Kuroshio Current, which is rich in nutrients, joins. Around the end of the Meiji era, a large amount of damselfish sometimes flowed in there. Damselfish were scooped up in order to secure the course of the ship, but they were difficult to dispose of, so they were sprinkled with salt and roasted later on, at which time it was discovered that they were fatty and delicious, and since then, they have been roasted and eaten. It is said that this came to be recognized as a specialty of Hakata after entering the Showa era when it began to be served at restaurants.It is said that the name of the dish is derived from the Japanese phrase for “let’s roast and bite into it” or the opinion that it has the umami of duck when roasted.",

Other Asian countries besides Japan also have words for pickles with similar pronunciations, such as “charre” and “ochore.” However, there are various theories as to the origin of the word, as it is said to mean “over there,” which implies foreign countries, and to refer to “Nanban-style pickles.”Hakata Bay has long flourished as a trading hub. It is said that achara-zuke were introduced to Japan through the Nanban trade, a period in history covering the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the early Edo period (1603-1868). It is also believed that red chili pepper, an essential ingredient for achara-zuke pickles, was introduced to Japan during the same period.",

The hard surface of the “Ago-Chikuwa\" is baked to a crisp, creating a delicious crunchy sound and aroma when the knife is inserted.

The characteristic of this chikuwa(=fish cake) is that it is darker in appearance than ordinary chikuwa(=fish cake).The name “Ago\" was introduced in a document over 400 years ago, and its origin is said to be \"because it tastes so good that the jaw falls off,\" but the origin of the word is not known. The season for flying fish is from spring to summer, when the spawning season begins. It is a popular taste that heralds the arrival of early summer. The taste is refreshing with little fat, and it is a healthy fish with high protein content. In Tottori Prefecture, the method used to catch horse mackerel is to attach dozens of white yellowtail plates to a rope, lure the fish in, and reel them in,Nearly 180 tons of this fish are landed annually.The two types of flying fish which is called the small round-jawed “Thin flying fish\" and the large square-jawed angular-jawed “Tsukushi flying fish\" are caught .",

    "history": "Flying fish is the prefectural fish of Shimane Prefecture and is known as the fish that heralds early summer among the local people. In mid-May or later, it migrates to Oki island. There are two types of flying fish in Shimane Prefecture - the Hosotobi Uo and Tsukushi Uo. The former is called \"maru (round) ago\" and the latter \"kaku (square) ago\". Together, they are called \"ago\". Flying fish has been rooted as an everyday food since ancient times and is also known as \"taue sakana\". This term was passed down among local farmers who served flying fish to their helpers during rice planting. A long time ago, people used to say, \"If we can't get flying fish, we can't plant rice\". There are many dishes made with flying fish, including sashimi and fried fish, but the delicacy of flying fish roe is frequently consumed. Compared to cod roe and salmon roe, flying fish roe is characterized by its large size and somewhat tough skin. Each roe is also harder to break apart and has a sticky texture. Many locals enjoy this unique texture and flavor. The locals recommend agono ko umani (braised flying fish roe), which goes well with sake. Dishes using the roe of flying fish are well-loved and eaten by locals. The roe of flying fish is only available during the spawning season of flying fish, so some locals say that they are more precious than the meat itself and are a luxury item.",

    "history": "Daikon radich has been consumed since ancient times and is mentioned in Japan's oldest documents, the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki.\" The name \"daikon\" itself is said to have originated from its large size, being called \"oone\" or from its white color and cool appearance, referred to as \"suzushiro.\" The Shosoin documents mention the use of Chinese characters to represent daikon radish. Pickling vegetables with salt for preservation is documented in various historical sources such as the wooden tablets from the Heijo Palace, the Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), and the Engishiki (an ancient law book). However, the mention of pickling with rice bran, known as nukazuke, seems to date back to the Muromachi period. This reflects the value of rice during that time.As for takuan-zuke, it is said to have been devised by the Zen monk Takuan (1573-1646) in the Edo period, or alternatively, it was named by Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604-1651), who visited the temple where Takuan belonged. Some sources suggest that the term \"takuan\" derived from \"takuwaedzuke.\"The dish \"ahodaki\" is a preserved side dish that ingeniously reuses takuan, which tends to lose its flavor and smell around the following summer after pickling. This regional dish reflects the wisdom of enjoying food without wasting it. The takuan preserved in a barrel loses its flavor each time it is taken out. \"Ahodaki\" involves re-cooking it in soy sauce after removing excess salt. The unique name is said to come from the idea of doing something foolish by removing the salt just to re-cook it in soy sauce when it's delicious.Due to its elaborate preparation, it is also known as \"daimyo-ni\" (feudal lord's cooking). Similar dishes are found in other prefectures, such as \"takuan no nitan\" in Fukui, \"okumoji\" in Ishikawa, and \"irikogu\" or \"irigoki\" in Toyama, all employing a similar cooking method.",

It is said that around the Kamakura period (1185-1333), Anyo Shonin, the founder of Amidadera Temple, brought the seeds of corn, the ingredient of \"aka-mochi\" (red rice cake), from his native Gunma Prefecture to Nagasu, Bando City, and introduced them there. When the Tone River floods due to heavy rainfall, most crops along the river are adversely affected by water damage, but only tall corn avoided flood damage. Because rice wasn't as abundantly harvested as it is now, it is believed that 'Akamochi,' made from corn, became a source of food. Corn is an annual grass of the Poaceae family. In the summer, it produces ears, and as the autumn harvest approaches, the nutritious grain changes to a reddish-purple color. 'Akamochi' is made by grinding this into powder, and it cannot be made without red corn flour. ecause it can be cultivated in regions where rice and wheat may have difficulty growing, it was often grown in areas prone to flooding, such as rural areas along the Tone River, Naka River (Nakagawa), and Kuji River. However, nowadays, with land improvement leading to the creation of paddy fields, the number of people cultivating corn has become limited, and obtaining corn flour consistently has become challenging. In an era when rice cultivation was not as reliable due to weather conditions and other factors, 'Akamochi' was eaten not only as a staple food to fill the stomach but also enjoyed as a snack during breaks from agricultural work.",

The stems have low bitterness and take on a beautiful red color, so they’ve been used for pickles since ancient times.As for how they’re pickled, a small amount of salt is rubbed in these stems and a weight is placed on them so the water rises overnight as it soaks. Once the stems become soft, they’re sprinkled with vinegar. Black liquid rises to the surface, so this is removed. After leaving it for a while, the color changes to red. When they turn a beautiful bright red, they’re ready to eat. Peel the skin, cut them into appropriate lengths, and eat them with soy sauce or ginger soy sauce. There were no refrigerators in the past, so these were pickled from mid-September until around the first frost and eaten during this period. It’s said that the ones harvested around the mid-autumn harvest moon have a particularly vibrant color, and even a slight variation in the pickling method can affect the color. It seems the women of the house worked very carefully when pickling the “akadozuke.” Vinegar is used to make these pickles, but when the temperature drops lactic acid fermentation is used instead of vinegar. It’s indispensable as a lunch box item for the farm work of autumn such as cutting hay. It’s a pickle that feels like the arrival of autumn for the people of Aso.",

This dish is a popular accompaniment to sake and rice, as the rich and flavorful roe perfectly complements the light and tender white meat. It is believed to have originated from the crucian carp dish that was also served with roe. The fishing season for flathead flounder runs from September to May. Winter is considered the peak season, as the fish is at its fattiest during this time. The fish's name, which translates to \"red patterned flatfish,\" comes from the red patterns on its belly, which is an indicator of its deliciousness. The fresher the fish is, the clearer these patterns are visible. The meat of the flathead flounder is white, tender, and plump, without being too soft or mushy. Female fish that have already spawned are more expensive, but are also more flavorful due to their higher fat content. In Tottori Prefecture, they are often served boiled. Flathead flounder is rich in vitamins B1, B2, and D, as well as collagen. It is also a great source of protein, while being low in fat and calories.",

This dish is eaten in appreciation of completing the rice planting and to pray for a good harvest.The homemade flour of that time was brown, since the entire grain was ground into a powder. The resulting mochi was brown, and the appearance of the finished dish resembled \"a cat's round back,\" so it came to be called \"Akaneko (neko meaning cat).\"",

These soybeans are exceptional, with larger size and higher sugar content compared to regular soybeans. They are approximately 1.6 times the size of typical soybeans, and when lined up, 10 beans span about 6 sun (18cm or 7 inches), earning them the alternate name \"Tourokusun\". The ideal conditions for Akebono Soybeans in Minobu Town include a climate with significant temperature differences between day and night, frequent fog, and soil referred to as \"conglomerate gravel layer\".Despite being renowned for their quality, Akebono Soybeans face challenges due to their regional specificity, labor-intensive cultivation practices throughout all stages, and the aging population of producers. This has led to a decrease in harvest volume, making these soybeans difficult to obtain, earning them the nickname \"phantom soybeans.\" Young edamame from Akebono Soybeans are particularly rare, as they are only available for a brief period during the harvest season.Efforts have been made to revitalize the region through a collaborative approach among producers, resulting in increased production. Akebono Soybeans are now processed into tofu, miso, croquettes, natto, and other products, contributing to local culinary diversity. It has become a common saying that when attempting to grow Akebono Soybeans in other regions, the first-year harvest may yield large soybeans, but subsequent years may result in smaller beans that lose the distinctive qualities of Akebono Soybeans. Thus, the phrase \"Akebono Soybeans are truly Akebono Soybeans when grown in Akebono\" is an often expressed statement.",

It tastes sweet, and is popular among the locals for its delicious sweetness when sprinkled with sesame salt. Since it is made without using sasage or azuki beans, the glutinous rice does not turn red, but is instead colored with food coloring. Japanese confectionery stores and supermarkets sell both sweet sekihan made with amanatto and non-sweet sekihan made with sasage or azuki beans, which are well-known throughout Japan. Since ancient times, the color red has been believed to ward off evil spirits. For this reason, \"sweet red rice with red beans\" is just as essential for festive occasions as non-sweet red rice. Although sweet sekihan seems very unusual, it is also eaten in parts of Hokkaido and Tohoku, far from Yamanashi Prefecture. There are many theories about its roots, including one that the Nanbu clan, who moved from Kai no Kuni (Yamanashi Prefecture) to Aomori Prefecture during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), introduced it to the region, and another that amanatto was added to school lunches in Yamanashi Prefecture 50 years ago after hearing about it from people in Aomori.",

And the meticulous process of thoroughly removing the sliminess, carefully simmering, and skillfully crafting the tsume (sauce), which are distinctive features of anago, was indeed a technique achievable only by sushi artisans.In the present day, the variety of fish available in Tokyo Bay is limited, and their numbers have been declining. Despite these challenges, anago continues to be caught in Tokyo Bay and is highly esteemed, receiving acclaim as a top-quality ingredient nationwide.

After the castle town was built in Takeda Village, the city developed with a focus on commerce. Although much of the scenery of the old days was eventually lost during the Sounan War, the city center still retains some of its old features, such as the samurai residences.During the Edo period (1603-1867), when the transportation infrastructure was not well-developed, people in this inland area, far from the sea, had few opportunities to eat sea fish, and fresh seafood was rarely consumed. In order to use rare fish and shellfish without wasting them, the \"head dish\" was invented.The head is used in a wide variety of dishes, including the gills, jaw, and entrails, as well as the meat of the fish. The ingredients used in \"head dishes\" include not only the meat of the fish, but also the gills, jaw, and entrails, leaving only the head. These are then quickly blanched in hot water and served on a platter. The ingredients used include ara, kue, nibe, grouper, and other large fish. The large fish are used in their entirety and enjoyed with family and guests.",

Touching on Shinran’s teachings, people eat vegetarian Buddhist cuisine with the intent to devote themselves religiously once again. In Fukui Prefecture, which is ardent in its faith in Jodo Shinshu, meals during Hoonko were accompanied by atsuage (called aburaage in Fukui Prefecture), which were considered a treat. In every neighborhood, there was at least one house which was a tofu seller, and people would exchange soybeans for tofu or aburaage. It is said that even in typical homes, dishes which used atsuage spread easily. In Fukui Prefecture, where the consumption of aburaage was no. 1 for over 50 years (Family Budget Survey (Households of Two or More People) Prefectural Capital City and Ordinance-Designated City Rankings by Item (2017-2019 Annual Average) Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Statistics Bureau), aburaage indicates thick fried tofu with a hefty mass, also called “atsuage” in other prefectures; since one can obtain and taste a variety of types, each household apparently has its own favorite “atsuage.”",

One of them is that it was not easy to transport abundant seafood from the neighboring Suruga Bay (Shizuoka Prefecture) across mountains without transportation and refrigeration facilities as is the case today, and only a few salted or dried fish were delivered. In the Edo period, fresh abalone from Suruga Bay was processed, marinated in soy sauce, and packed in wooden casks for transportation. There is also a theory that Shingen Takeda, noting the nutritional value of abalone, invented abalone as a campaign food. Compared to raw abalone, boiled abalone contains more glutamic acid and aspartic acid, which increases its flavor, and this may be the reason why it became a specialty of inland regions.",

The connection with soumen in the Banshu area of Hyogo Prefecture can be seen in an ancient document from Ikaruga Temple (Taishi Town, Ibo-gun), which mentions soumen in a clause dated 1418 (Oei 25). It was during the Edo period that soumen production came into full swing, and was encouraged as a permitted industry by the Tatsuno clan during the Anei era (1771-1780). During the Bunka era (1804-1818), the Tatsuno clan began to protect and foster the product. Ibo No Ito flourished as a traditional industry in the Banshu region, thanks to the availability of wheat (wheat harvested in the Banshu Plain), water (the clear waters of the Ibo River), and salt (salt from Ako), which were important conditions for making soumen, and also as it became a side business during the winter farm-closing season. Ibo No Ito is classified into seven grades according to the season when it is made, the type of flour used, and the fineness of the noodles, and is widely used for everything from everyday household items to luxury gifts.",

    "history": "Mackerel has long been a popular fish among the people of Tango Peninsula, which faces Wakasa Bay. At a time when refrigeration technology was not yet developed, mackerel lost its freshness very quickly, so innovations were devised to prolong the enjoyment of mackerel. “Heshiko”, which is marinated in salt and then pickled in sake lees, is another dish that was created to prolong the quality of mackerel, and grilling is another method of preserving them. It is said that the mackerel was either grilled or salted before being transported inland on the \"Mackerel Road\", the route used to transport fish and shellfish from Wakasa Bay to the capital (Kyoto). Accordingly, many of the local dishes around Mackerel Road are made with grilled mackerel. “Barazushi” is another local dish that uses grilled mackerel, and is characterized by its minced mackerel and a variety of other ingredients on top. \"Matsubuta\", a shallow wooden box, a sushi-kiri (a spatula for separating Barazushi), a tetsuki (colander), and other unique tools are used. Locals often call it \"Barazushi\", but officially it is called \"Tango Barazushi\". The most popular theory about the origin of \"Barazushi\" is that the ingredients and mackerel are scattered on top of the sushi rice (onomatopoeia “bara bara”), but there is another theory that it comes from mixing the sushi rice in a flat colander called a \"baratetsuki\". In the past, people used to boil mackerel for a long time to make mince, but nowadays they often use canned food as a substitute. As a result, local supermarkets sell oversized cans of mackerel that are not found in other parts of the country.",

Thinly sliced raw horse meat is served with thinly sliced onions, grated ginger, garlic, etc., and dipped in sweet soy sauce. Low in fat and calories, high in protein, and rich in minerals such as iron, calcium, and zinc, horse meat is now a popular ingredient, but it has also long been consumed in Kumamoto as a fortifying and nourishing food.There are various theories as to the origin of \"Basashi(Horse sashimi)\", but it is said that when Kiyomasa Kato, the first lord of the Kumamoto domain, was leading his army in Korea, he ran out of food on the Korean Peninsula and was forced to kill his military horses for food. He found them so delicious that he continued to enjoy horse meat and \"Basashi(Horse sashimi)\" after returning to Japan. Meat consumption was almost non-existent during the Edo period, and only a few farmers ate it, but it become widespread in Kumamoto and the Aso region during the Meiji Era. In the Aso region, which produced military horses, people began eating horse meat due to postwar food shortages, leading to the practice being widespread, and restaurants began serving horse meat in the 1950s. \"Basashi(Horse sashimi)\" tastes different depending on the cut, such as marbled meat (loin), lean meat (thigh), liver, and tongue. There are also many terms unique to horse meat, such as \"futaego\" (belly), \"nekko\" (aorta), and \"kone\" (fat beneath the mane). Horse meat is labelled differently depending on their place of origin. \"Kumamoto-produced horse meat\" is produced using horses that are born and raised in Kumamoto, and \"Kumamoto horse meat\" is produced using foals that have been imported from countries such as Canada and fed carefully selected feed for 1 to 1.5 years to improve the quality of their meat.Horses have a higher body temperature than cows and pigs, making it difficult for bacteria that can cause food poisoning to multiply, which is one of the reasons why horse meat can be eaten raw. In addition, horse meat is processed in thoroughly sanitized meat processing plants, and is always frozen before distribution as an anti-parasite measure.",

The name \"battera,\" which means \"small boat\" in Portuguese, was derived from the boat-like shape of the half-meat sushi, which was originally made from konoshiro (whitebait) commonly caught in Osaka Bay. The name \"batterella\" was derived from the Portuguese word for \"small boat.\" It was gradually replaced by the inexpensive mackerel, and the square box shape was also used for the pressed molds.

The main ingredient is the innards of the common squid, but the ingredients used vary depending on the region, such as Japanese sardines, round herring, mackerel, and horse mackerel. In addition, “narezushi,” which is said to be the origin of sushi, and “kaburazushi,” a representative of Kaga cuisine, are local dishes that make use of fermentation.Rice bran sardines, which are sardines pickled in rice bran, are also a traditional fermented dish in Ishikawa Prefecture. It is said that it became popular as a way to preserve large quantities of sardines at a time when there was no refrigeration technology. A long time ago, it was an indispensable preserved food in mountain villages during winter when food was scarce.It can be grilled with the rice bran still on, or it can be eaten as sashimi after washing the rice bran off with water. Since it has a high salt content, it goes well with rice as well as with alcohol.In the Noto region, “bekanabe,” a dish made with rice bran sardines, has been popular for a long time. It is a hotpot dish made with rice bran sardines, salted Chinese cabbage, mushrooms, etc. boiled in lees. As sardines are an economically popular fish, it is said that common people often had conversations such as “Shall we have it today too?” and “Shall we eat it tomorrow too?” This is said to be the origin of the “beka” in its name. In Chubu Noto, it is also called “kabushi” and “dobozuke.”Rice bran sardine kaiyaki, which uses scallops instead of a bowl, is a popular hotpot dish for one person.

In particular, it is said that the pickle culture flourished during the Edo period, and most people living in the urban areas of Edo no longer made pickles at home, so it was common to buy them at pickle shops. It is said that large households and wealthy merchants’ houses made contracts with farmers in Nerima Village to have them prepare a year's worth of pickles and deliver the required amount as needed. Speaking of radishes in Tokyo, Nerima daikon and Tokoji daikon, which inherited the trend, are famous. Both of them are very spicy and slightly bitter, so it was common to turn them into dried radish for takuan or to use them to make bettara-zuke.Bettara-zuke, which uses plenty of rice malt, has an elegant sweetness, and even today, it can be said to be an essential pickle for people's dining tables.",

These motsu kushis became popular among the locals and mine workers, and it became known as \"Bibai Yakitori\". Today, “Bibai Yakitori” still means “motsu kushi”, which they make by skewering different chicken parts, such as the head, skin, internal eggs, gizzards, and onions, and then grilling them on a skewer.One characteristic of \"Bibai Yakitori\" is that they use onions instead of leeks.

As well as Chiba, the main peanut producing areas also included Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Kagoshima, Tochigi, Nagasaki and Shizuoka prefectures. In Chiba, peanut farming was first trialled in 1876, in the Kujukuri Plain around Nango village, Sanbu district (now part of Sanmu city). The following year, the governor encouraged the prefecture's residents to grow them, and cultivation areas spread out from Asahi city. The peanut varieties of that time were susceptible to drought, however, and their planting gradually decreased. In the Taisho era (1912 - 1926), drought-resistant varieties were imported from China to the farmlands around Yachimata, and their cultivation boomed. They are currently grown throughout the prefecture, particularly in the Shimosa Plateau.Peanuts are adaptable, and suitable for growing in areas of well-drained volcanic ash soil. Chiba prefecture, located in the Kanto loam where volcanic ash from Mt Fuji and Mt Hakone lies thick, grows the most peanuts of anywhere in Japan, accounting for over 70% of the nation's output. They command a high market price, with many being used for cooking and processed foods. \"Boiled peanuts\" are a seasonal item in the areas they are grown, and are only made with peanuts freshly picked from the fields (fresh peanuts quickly begin to harden and lose their flavour once they are harvested; they will not taste very good if they are not boiled as soon as they are dug up).",

Yuzu trees can be found everywhere in the prefecture and are a fruit that even people who are not involved in agriculture are well-acquainted with.There is a large temperature differential between day and night in Hita City, and this produces Yuzu with a rich aroma and high quality. The “JA Oita Hita Yuzu Group” is made up of about 80 growers who grow Yuzu on fields totaling about 30 ha. Green Yuzu shipments begin in late august, while ripe, yellow-colored Kogyoku Yuzu are shipped from around November. Most of the Yuzu that are shipped both within and outside of Oita prefecture are used in processed foods such as juice or yuzu pepper.In Hita City and other yuzu-producing regions, there are many other ways to enjoy yuzu besides using the peel and juice in cooking. For example, “Boiled Yuzu Peel” glazes the Yuzu peel, and this can be served with tea or used as a New Year’s dish. “Yuzu-neri”, made by boiling sweetened, and thinly sliced Yuzu can be eaten as is or spread on bread. It can be served as “Yuzu Tea” if mixed with hot water. In addition, Yuzu also has many non-food uses such as a skin lotion prepared by soaking Yuzu seeds in shochu or being places in the bath during the winter solstice.",

Eel farming began in Yoshida Town with the formation of eel ponds on unused rice paddies flooded out by the Oi River during the Taisho era, and utilized the basin’s underground water. Yoshida Town’s eels are well known for being fatty and soft.“Bokumeshi” is a mixed rice made by combining boiled eel and burdock root to cooked rice. The name is derived from a thick stake called a “bokkui.” At the time, eels that were too fat were unsellable, so the eel farmers began to eat them and it is said that the meal eventually came to be called “bokumeshi.”Since the latter half of the 1950s, eels have been farmed so much that they account for 40% of Japan’s eel production（※）. Because eel could be bought locally and in large quantities, bokumeshi was a staple in many households, but in recent years the price of eel has increased and there are less opportunities to make it at home.Source: Yoshimachi Public Corporation website",

Many soybeans are ground up and added in.” Zen Buddhist (one type of Buddhism, a sect of Mahayana Buddhism) households don’t eat meat or fish, and instead would eat miso soup with lots of seasonal vegetables as ingredients instead of a dashi stock made of bonito flakes or dried sardines, because killing is not allowed during Obon. Dashi stock isn’t used because it’s made of dried bonito or dried sardines, but fried tofu is used instead. By adding a lot of ingredients, the soup is delicious even without adding dashi stock. Also, since it’s made to welcome the ancestors on the Bon Festival, it’s characterized by having more types and amounts of ingredients than normal soup. Since there are so many ingredients, it’s like a boiled vegetable dish. In the northeastern part of Matsuzaka City in particular, yard beans (juroku sasage) are called bon sasage, and it’s said that they’re always put in the dish because they’re ready to eat around the time of the Bon Festival. Depending on the region, this soup is also called “nana iro jiru” because it uses 7 (nana) kinds of ingredients. In Sugari, Owase City in the Eastern Kishu region they make “hachihai” with tofu and “hyuga jiru” (clear soup) with gourd shavings on the day when they send off spirits.",

Nowadays, “Bonito tataki” is a nationwide menu, but in Kochi Prefecture, the particulars and recipes vary slightly by region and community. In Kochi Prefecture, where tataki cuisine is popular, foodstuffs other than bonito fish are also eaten as tataki, such as moray eels and other fish, meat, shiitake mushrooms, pumpkins and eggplants, depending on the region.

Farmed yellowtail is now common, but wild yellowtail is said to be far superior in terms of fatty flavor and firmness.

It is a prized fish used in celebrations and gifts at the end of the year. It is also appreciated as a good luck food, as the name of the fish changes according to its size, such as \"Kozokura\", \"Fukuragi\" and \"Gando\", which looks like it is promoted. During the Edo period (1603 - 1868), freshly caught yellowtail was offered to the lord of the feudal domain before it was sold in the castle town. It was such a high-class foodstuff that there was a saying that \"a piece of yellowtail is equal to a sack of rice\", and was rarely consumed by the common people. You can enjoy a variety of yellowtail dishes in the prefecture, including the now-standard \"Buri Daikon\" (yellowtail and Japanese radish) and sashimi, as well as \"Kabura Zushi\" (yellowtail sandwiched between pickled turnip) and \"Maki Buri\" (fermented yellowtail).",

A native breed called \"Shimabuta\" was also bred in the Amami region. It is thought that foreign culture was able to permeate and influence the \"Satsuma domain\" due to the fact that the Ryukyu Islands, which were was far away from Edo and a territory of the \"Satsuma domain\", were involved in international trade. \"Kurobuta\" is also said to have been brought to the Ryukyu Islands by \"Shimazu Iehisa\", a famous Satsuma military commander during the Edo period. Later on, during the Meiji period, they were further improved by cross-breeding with the British Berkshire breed. There was a time when the fast growing \"Shirobuta\" were bred more and \"Kurobuta\" were bred less, but through the promotion of the tender and flavorful \"Kurobuta\", it became established as the \"Kagoshima Kurobuta\" brand of today. The mild climate of Kagoshima Prefecture also enables an abundant cultivation of barley miso. Barley miso from Kagoshima Prefecture is made using more koji and less salt to result in a sweeter flavor. Thus, Kagoshima Prefecture features many dishes that use pork and miso, such as \"Tonkotsu\" and \"Buta Miso.\" \"Butajiru\" is another a typical example.",

It is known as a home-style dish throughout Okinawa Prefecture, and is also becoming popular in other Prefectures as well. In Okinawan dialect, “shiri-shiri” is a word that refers to the action of grating. It an onomatopoeia for the sound made when grating ingredients. In the Prefecture, carrots are grated using a specialized, large grater-like pan called a “shiri-shiri” pan. However, if no “shiri-shiri” pan is available, the carrots can simply be shredded. It is said that most households have a “shiri-shiri” pan in their kitchens. Incidentally, “shiri-shiri” pans can be used not just with carrots, but also with daikon radishes and green papayas. Carrot “Shiri-shiri” is colorful, beautiful, and nutritious, as well as being easy to make with simple, everyday ingredients, such as carrots and eggs. The sweetness of the carrots is brought out by stir-frying them. What’s more, the addition of eggs means that they have less of their distinctive smell, making the dish easy to eat for adults and children alike. Incidentally, Okinawa Prefecture boasts the largest consumption of carrots in Japan.",

    "history": "“Casa muchi” (also called muchi, casa muchi, onimochi) is a steamed rice cake wrapped in a shell ginger leaf. It is offered to the gods to dispel evil spirits on December 8th of the lunar calendar, an annual event in which the health of the family is prayed for. The origin of the name “onimochi” is based on folklore, and is said to be from folk tales which remain in Shurikinjocho. A brother and sister lost their parents at an early age, and when the sister came of age and married, her brother who lived slovenly by himself became a demon who ate not only livestock but children. In an attempt to do something, the sister made his beloved rice cake and put steel inside, and while he ate it she pushed him from a cliff and eradicated him. The fragrant smell of the shell ginger leaf when steaming the rice cake acts as a purifier which wafts through the house. From the demon-dispelling episode, the custom remains to sprinkle the water used to steam the rice cake around the house, tie the shell ginger leaf in a cross shape and hang it on eaves and places where people enter and exit in order to ward off evil. Recently, not only has there been white muchi made simply from sticky rice flour, but also many variations based on region and family, such as ones which use brown sugar, purple yam, or sorghum. Casa muchi is an indispensable winter food in Okinawa, and a true feature of the season. The first muchi after a boy’s birth is celebrated with kamuchi, an especially large muchi made with a Chinese fan palm leaf. Additionally, regardless of gender, the first muchi that a child has is called “hatsu muchi”, and it is customarily given out to relatives and neighbors.",

It seems that chagayu has a long history. It is a local dish that was invented in an area with low rice yields, where rice is conserved by increasing the amount of water used. In areas where chagayu is prepared, tea plants are planted near homes. In the Iga region, there was little cultivated land, and white rice was so precious that people did not have the opportunity to eat it as part of their daily meal, but only on occasions such as Obon, the New Year, festivals, and when entertaining guests. The staple foods were usually barley rice and porridge, and chagayu was often eaten to bulk up the volume of these foods. It is said that in the past, all three meals consisted of just chagayu and takuan. Vegetables and legumes were added as ingredients, and these ingredients were seasonal so that they never got boring. In addition, in the Kumano region, porridge was often eaten, so there was a song all about eating porridge that goes, “Morning, noon, and dinner, we eat porridge. There isn’t a midnight snack? It's time to go to bed.” In the Iga region, there is a song that goes, “Chagayu for breakfast and lunch and porridge for dinner.” Kayumi, Iinan-cho, Matsusaka City is a tea-producing region and is also an area where chagayu was a popular meal.",

It is said that the English name “chayote” was passed down to Kochi Prefecture, and was corrupted to become “chate.” The fruits come in a variety of shapes, including pear, oval, and conical shapes. The colors vary from whitish to greenish.It is easy to grow and is a popular ingredient, especially in mountainous regions. It is rarely cultivated for commercial purposes and is often cultivated for home consumption. Many households grow them in their vegetable gardens or as green curtains for shade. For this reason, it is common for neighbors to share chate among themselves.Chate is often used as an ingredient in everyday home cooking, and chate aemono is especially easy to prepare, so it is easy to add to your daily cooking repertoire.",

The taste is made possible by the sweet and spicy sauce made with sugar and soy sauce, and is loved by children and adults alike. The crispy fried chicken meat is satisfying and combines perfectly with the flavor of gobou(=burdock) root, and the inclusion of edamame (=green soybeans) adds a nice colorful touch.

Around 1950, shortly after the end of WWII, the second-generation owner of Okuto Honten Kunimoten, a soba noodle restaurant established in 1913 in Kofu City, was asked by a butcher if there was anything he could do with the chicken parts that were thrown away. At that time, there was still a shortage of food, and after much trial and error to make a cheap and tasty dish, he developed Chicken Motsuni, which was simmered in soy sauce and sugar, both of which were precious commodities at that time. The sweet-salty flavor goes well with alcohol and is the perfect topping for rice, making the dish a staple at izakaya, set menu restaurants, and soba noodle restaurants, and a favorite of Kofu residents. Although “Motsuni” usually refers to a soup dish that has been simmered for a long time, Chicken Motsuni is made in a unique way by quickly braising chicken liver and other ingredients in a small amount of sauce over a high flame to lock in the flavor and sweetness of the chicken innards. The origin of the name of the ingredient “kinkan” is also interesting.",

The colostrum is heated and solidified to create this dish, which is considered a traditional type of cheese in Japan. However, due to the quick souring of colostrum, it did not enter general circulation and remained a local delicacy enjoyed among dairy farming households.In different regions, this dish is known by various names such as \"Chikko Katametano\" (meaning \"hardened milk\") and \"Mineoka Tofu.\" There is also a variation called \"milk tofu,\" where regular milk is used instead of colostrum, making it suitable for general consumption.

It is also customary to make chobojiru at the time of a child's shrine visit and distribute it to relatives and acquaintances.The name \"chobo soup\" comes from the wish that the child will have a cute chobo mouth. The dumplings in the soup are either hollowed out in the middle or rounded if the baby is a girl, or pointed if the baby is a boy. If it is a boy, the dumplings should be pointed. This is to wish for the healthy growth of the child.",

    "history": "\"Choji-fu no Karashi-ae\" is a classic regional cuisine made with choji-fu, a type of wheat gluten from Shiga Prefecture. Choji-fu is a rectangular baked wheat gluten a little larger than the size of a matchbox. It is baked on all six sides so it can be used in various dishes such as hot pot and udon without falling apart in the broth, and it is a nutritious ingredient that is rich in plant-based protein. It is an essential ingredient in Buddhist cuisine, and is characterized by a chewy and smooth texture. There are many different theories about the origin of the name Choji-fu, with no single explanation. The name Choji-fu appears in the literature of the Yawata townspeople during the late Edo period in regard to souvenirs and offerings for congratulations or condolences. In general, the production of baked wheat gluten began to spread in various regions starting in the Meiji period, following the importation of refined wheat flour that began with the opening of the ports at the end of the Edo period.\"Choji-fu no Karashi-ae\" is eaten throughout the prefecture, particularly in the Koto area, and is a standard dish served to guests, such as during family gatherings. Pre-made karashi-ae (mustard sauce) is commercially available, and the dish is easy to make, so it is eaten as a regular household dish in addition to serving guests. Cucumbers are mixed with the karashi sumiso (mustard vinegar miso) to achieve a pleasant and refreshing taste, and it stimulates the appetite on hot days. The uncut choji-fu is dressed with karashi-ae and served whole at Buddhist memorial services.",

In the sandy coastal areas of Kashima-nada, large clams can be caught in spring before they release their eggs. Clam exceeding 10 cm are sometimes caught and sold at high prices in the market under the name of “Kashima-nada Clams.” Officially called “Chosen Hamaguri (Korean Clams)” in Japanese, the clams have been branded as “Kashima-nada Clams” through prefectural-wide efforts since 1995 as they could easily be mistaken for an imported product if sold under this name.Today, most of the clams available in Japan are imported, with domestically produced clams accounting for only 10% of total production, making them a rare commodity, more than half of which are caught in the Kashima-nada Sea. In order to preserve the rare “Kashima-nada Clams,” the three fishing cooperatives of Oarai-cho, Kashima-nada, and Hasaki have been working to preserve the clams through strict management, including rotational fishing.Although clams are now rare, they were once a familiar delicacy in Ibaraki Prefecture, as they were often caught in the coastal areas of Oarai and Rokko. Freshly caught clams have been enjoyed in a variety of ways, from raw or grilled, to an ingredient in miso soup or steamed. Clam rice is another classic clam dish that is often eaten in Japanese households.",

The original “Omi Hinokabu” variety was then adapted and improved to suit the Matsuyama region and became a local specialty.The vibrant crimson color of the turnip is a result of the anthocyanin pigments in the turnip reacting with the bitter orange juice. Even the renowned haiku poet Shiki Masaoka, who had connections to Ehime, composed a haiku praising this pickle: \"Crimson turnips, around the meal tray, a scene of spring.\" Loved by many, this pickle evokes nostalgia for those who have left their hometowns.",

The Western cuisine in Japan was influenced by French and British food cultures due to modernization. While the French croquette is often cited as its origin, it actually referred to a croquette with béchamel sauce. During the Taisho era, cream croquettes were the main type served in Western-style restaurants. Additionally, the spread of British dishes using potatoes, as seen in stews and fish & chips, played a role in the creation of the original Japanese potato croquette.In Tokyo, Western cuisine was introduced as early as 1870 (Meiji 3) at \"Tsukiji Seiyo Ken Hotel,\" and around Meiji 30, there were about 40 Western-style restaurants. While Western dishes were initially considered special occasion food for certain classes during the early Meiji period, they gradually became a part of everyday meals for the general population by the mid-Meiji period. The late Taisho to early Showa period saw population concentration in Tokyo due to economic prosperity from World War I. This period established the style of serving Western-style dishes with rice, and croquette was one of the staple menu items in this urban culinary scene, marking the beginning of \"Western cuisine\" in Japan.",

In the Karatsu area, it is popular to cut all ingredients into strips, while konnyaku is cut into triangles for Buddhist ceremonies. For weddings and funerals, lotus root, dried shiitake mushrooms, konnyaku, kikurage, frozen konnyaku, and chicken are used, while fu is added for celebratory occasions. Especially in the Hamadama area, it is made without thickening. In other areas, ingredients are cut into squares and hanafu is used for celebratory events such as marriages and other festive occasions. Some people also do not use sugar for seasoning. Conversely, on occasions of mourning, the ingredients are cut into triangles and sugar is used. The seasoning differs from household to household, but in the past, people in the community, including neighbors, would gather together to jointly make a large quantity at a time.",

It is said that the name \"dumako\" came from its resemblance to a rice dumpling, or otedama.

Since most of the grain was made into flour, the flour-based food culture has taken root in many places in Oita Prefecture. “Dango Jiru” (dumpling soup) is a good example of this. Dumplings made by kneading wheat flour and stretching it into thin strips, along with other ingredients, are served in a soup made with barley miso, which are popular in Kyushu, combined miso or white miso. It was routinely eaten as a substitute for rice at a time when rice was in short supply. The word \"dango\" is usually thought of as a spherical dumpling, but in Oita, the dumpling is stretched out by hand. It is firmer than Udon, and you can enjoy its chewy texture. It looks like Kishimen noodles, but the name is said to have originated from the fact that it is rolled up and laid down for a while as if you were making dumplings. The reason for making a thin strip afterwards is to help the flavors soak in when they are cooked in the soup. In Fukuoka and Kumamoto prefectures it is called \"Dago Jiru\".",

It has long been a popular speedy dish to make during the busy farming season. There are a number of theories as to the origin of the word \"Dashi\" (soup stock), for example, because “Dashi” brings out the best in other ingredients; “Dashi” comes from the word “Kiridasu” (cut from) used when vegetables are chopped into small pieces using a knife; and “Dashi” comes from the word “Dasu” (serve) used when vegetables are quickly served at the table after being chopped and seasoned. If there are 100 houses, there will be 100 different flavors of “Dashi”, and it is very interesting to see how many different recipes there are. The basic ingredients are eggplants and cucumbers, but some families add green perilla, myoga, green onions, and onions to the ingredients.

Some of the kanten produced in the northern Settsu region was exported overseas through Nagasaki.One confection made using locally produced kanten is \"Decchi Yokan.” Unlike the more expensive sugar-intensive smooth yokan (a sweet bean jelly), Decchi Yokan uses less sugar and does not have a long shelf life, making it more suitable for winter production and consumption. It features a modest and refreshing taste.The name Decchi Yokan has two potential origins: one theory suggests that it is named so because the reduction process during cooking is not as thorough as in the case of smooth yokan, making it like a \"half-portion\" similar to that of an apprentice (Decchi)); another theory suggests that it was called this because it was an inexpensive treat brought back as a souvenir by apprentices when they returned home.It's worth noting that in Kawachi, a variant of Decchi Yokan is made using wheat flour instead of kanten, and it is steamed, resulting in a different texture.",

When making kneaded yokan, agar is used, but it is said that wheat flour was used as a binding agent instead of agar because it was difficult to obtain in Omi, where there is no direct access to the sea. However, in the Shigaraki region, decchi-yokan refers to mizu-yokan hardened with agar.There is a theory that the name “decchi-yokan” came from the fact that it was an inexpensive confectionery that even apprentices (“decchi” in Japanese) with low wages could purchase when apprentices who had come from the Omihachiman area to serve in Osaka, Kanto, and other places all over the country returned to their parents' homes. There is also a theory that when these apprentices returned to their hometowns, they made yokan, which they then brought back to the masters and clerks they were serving as a souvenir, and it was received with joy. There are various other theories as well, such as the fact that kneading is also called “decchiru” in confectionery store terminology and the process of kneading red bean paste and wheat flour together led to it being called “decchi-yokan.” In addition, apprentices served merchant families with the goal of becoming merchants themselves in the future.In 1998, this specialty of Shiga Prefecture, decchi-yokan, was selected as a “property of Shiga’s food culture,” an intangible folk cultural property of Shiga Prefecture.",

It is said that village had its own tofu cabin, where a number of people gathered and made tofu from home-grown soybeans. This is a traditional food with all sorts of locally grown ingredients, which uses seasonal vegetables that can be picked at the time including carrots, burdock root, and green onions, dried shiitake or fried tofu slices which bring out the flavors of the takikomi gohan (rice cooked with ingredients). In the past, it was vegetable-only, but chicken meat began to be included in the Showa period, when people started raising chickens. Originally it was a takikomi-gohan, but from the mid-Showa period on when rice cookers became popularized, it has gradually become a maze-gohan (rice that is cooked and then mixed with ingredients).",

Cod, as shown in its kanji character ('snow' on the right and the 'fish' radical on the left), comes into season during the snowy season. Especially in the Shonai region, the cod caught during the cold season of the 24 divisions of the old calendar (from early January to early February) is called \"Kandara (cold cod)\". At this time of year when the fish gather to spawn, Kandara trawl fishery is very popular. Fresh cod are eaten as sashimi or kombu-jime (wrapped in kelp), while others are preserved in miso or pickled in sake lees. Cod milt is known for its thick and creamy texture, and in recent years, fresh milt has been used as a sushi topping. “Dongara Jiru” (cod soup) is a local winter dish using Kandara. It was originally eaten by fishermen on the beach. It is characterized by the use of Kandara from head to tail without leaving anything. \"Dongara\" is a word that refers to bony parts. “Dongara Jiru\" is named after the soup in which the bony parts of Kandara are boiled. It is also known as \"Kandara Jiru” (cold cod soup). Every January, “Kandara Matsuri”, a festival to eat Kandara is held mainly in Sakata and Tsuruoka Cities in the Shonai region, where “Dongara Jiru” is served.",

It is mainly landed in Ishinomaki and Kesennuma ports in Miyagi Prefecture, and its catch has been decreasing year by year. The fish has a large mouth and a swollen belly that becomes narrower towards the tail. According to local beliefs, it is a lucky fish that helps people save money, as it is hard to get a lot in through the big mouth and out through the small buttocks. In the Kesennuma area, it is a custom to hang \"donko\" on the altar on \"Ebisukou day\" to pray for a big catch and prosperous business, and to eat them in soup. The flesh of \"donko\" becomes firmer in winter, and the liver becomes more fatty, making it even more delicious. The meat and bones are tender, and its white flesh and skin have no peculiarities, giving it an elegant flavor similar to cod. The liver tends to be preferred over the meat, and in the Sanriku region, it has long been eaten as \"nameko\", grilled whole, deep-fried, or in a nabe (hot pot), in a soup, and the liver gives a rich flavor to any dish. \"Donko jiru\" is a winter delicacy that uses plenty of donko, which goes well with miso. It is a local dish that warms the body from the inside out and is often eaten mainly in coastal areas. It is often prepared with vegetables such as daikon radish, carrots, and tofu.",

He transported them via the Izumo Highway to Okayama Prefecture and Osaka, making full use of overland and water routes. It is said that 20 to 30 people formed a convoy and walked through the Chugoku mountain range on a series of rough roads. The route taken by the convoy is also known as “Eel Road” or “Eel Highway,” with traces of it still evident today.Izumo eels are said to have had a great influence on the food culture in Osaka, so much so that at one time the city was flooded with eel restaurants named “Izumo-ya.” Because the idea of opening the belly of a fish is reminiscent of seppuku (ritual suicide), eel shops in the Kanto region serve eels with the back open and the head removed, while eels with the belly open and the head attached are the norm in the Kansai region. This culture of opening the belly is said to have come from Izumo, triggered by large eel shipments.Even today, eels are still eaten in the Izumo region, and are enjoyed in a variety of dishes such as shiroyaki (grilled eel without sauce), kabayaki (grilled eel with sauce), unaju (eel over rice), chirashizushi (scatted sushi), and “eel tofu” cooked Yanagawa hot pot style.",

The \"Daimon Somen\" made in Tonami City's Daimon district in Toyama Prefecture is said to have been handed down from Noto through medicine peddlers in the late Edo period. The vestiges of the production center of somen can be seen in the local dish, \"Eggplant Somen\", eaten in Kanazawa City. “Eggplant Somen\" is a dish of simmered eggplant and somen. Since the somen are simmered softly, they are eaten more like nimono (simmered dishes) than noodle dishes.",

In the days before refrigeration, well-preserved seafood was a valuable source of nutrients that were often deficient in the land-locked Nagano Prefecture.

In the Iiyama region, their version of \"Ego\" is simply boiled and dissolved. It is eaten in many areas excluding the southern regions, and is eaten with karashi (mustard) soy sauce, karashi sumiso (vinegar miso), plain karashi, etc. In Kijimadaira and Azumino (near Toyoshinaminamihotaka), it is called \"Igo\" and is sun-bleached prior to boiling and dissolving, then eaten with sansho (Japanese pepper) miso, bonito flake soy sauce, wasabi soy sauce, karashi soy sauce, etc. Egogusa brought from Niigata Prefecture was often sold out in the Hokushin area, and rarely reached the larger cities of Nagano and Matsumoto. This is said to be the reason why it spread and took root mainly in the northern part of Nagano Prefecture. As a regional cuisine of Niigata Prefecture,some areas have a custom of boiling and dissolving Egogusa in the original color, and other areas wet the Ego and dry it in the sun until it becomes white, then boil and dissolve before eating.

It is a dish that you never tire of eating, with a harmony between the mild-flavored fuka and light, tangy vinegar miso, and it is popular as a drinking snack or as part of a banquet platter. Fuka is eaten in many regions, including places far from the sea where it is difficult to obtain fresh fish, such as the mountainous parts of the Chugoku region. However, in Uwajima City, it is held in equally high regard as fresh sashimi.",

Today, there are two types of \"Fukagawa-meshi\": bukkake and takikomi. There is also \"Fukagawa nabe\" which is not served over rice.In the Edo period, there were many mud flats in what is now Tokyo Bay, which were a treasure house of shellfish. A part of the Oyokogawa River that runs south of the Eitai and Saga areas in Koto-ku was called Fukagawa-ura, and when the tide ebbed, a sandbar spread out and was famous as a fishing town where clams, clams, and green clams could be caught in abundance. Until the early Showa period (1926-1989), there were many food stalls selling Fukagawa-meshi in Asakusa, and the dish was well known and eaten at home. Since the Edo period (1603-1867), only the meat from the shell, called \"nukimi,\" had been sold, giving rise to \"takikomi-gohan\" (cooked rice with nukimi), and \"shirukake-meshi\" (rice with hot soup poured over it to keep it warm) became an established Edo way of eating rice.Due to the pollution of the water and the progress of land reclamation, the area lost its fishing grounds around Fukagawa due to the abandonment of fishing rights in the 1950s, but there are still tidal flats such as Sanbanze in the Chiba area where shellfish can be caught. In Fukagawa, the opening of the Basho Memorial Museum and the Fukagawa Edo Museum has brought tourists to the area, and the efforts of restaurants to revive the once beloved Fukagawa-meshi have brought it back to this area.The umami of fresh raw clams and coarsely chopped green onions is combined with miso, and this extract soaks into the rice, filling the mouth with an indescribable flavor, a traditional Edo food that still remains today.",

The Chita Peninsula has no major rivers, which has been a challenge for agriculture, but with the construction of the Aichi Irrigation Canal in the Showa period, the harvest became more stable. Currently, \"autumn butterbur\" is harvested from October to January of the following year, and \"spring butterbur\" is harvested from February to May.Aichi Prefecture, which is one of the top producers of butterbur in Japan, is also familiar with dishes using butterbur. One of the most popular dishes is \"fuki no nitsuke\" (stewed butterbur). The stems of Aichi early-blooming butterbur are very thick, so its crunchy texture can be enjoyed.",

In many areas of the prefecture, events are held to pray for a good harvest each year. In the Iga region, for example, people offer fukidawara (butterbur bales) to the god of the rice fields along with things like Japanese pampass grass, which easily diverts water to the mouth of the waterway, and the branches of chestnut trees, which bear large fruit, to pray for a good harvest and give thanks to the god when rice is planted for the first time. Thirteen fukidawara are placed on a colander and offered to the gods, one for each of the months of January through December and one for the god of the rice fields. Fukidawara, which look like small rice balls, are also made as a light lunch (snack) for rice planting. Wrapping the warm rice in a butterbur leaf enhances the aroma of the butterbur and salty flavor of the soybean rice. Fukidawara can also be made from fava beans, which are said to bring good luck because they are the only beans that grow upward, or other peas. Fukidawara exemplify the wisdom of daily life as they can be eaten as a snack or light lunch while working in the fields without having to wash your hands, while the leaves can be returned to nature after eating. Furthermore, in the Nakanosho region (Matsusaka City), “saburagi gohan” is made by wrapping soybean rice in a butterbur leaf, then tying it with straw. The name is derived from the fact that the dish is made during the “saburagi (opening of the rice fields)” event to pray for a good harvest.",

The Shimonoseki area has a particularly long history of fugu eating, and is known as the home of fugu, with a high concentration of processing plants and restaurants, and natural and cultured fugu from all over the country. There was once a time when eating fugu was prohibited. This was because Hideyoshi Toyotomi issued a ban on eating fugu after a soldier died from eating fugu during his expedition to Korea. Later, Hirobumi Ito was impressed by the taste of fugu, and the ban was lifted only in Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1888. The first restaurant officially authorized to serve fugu cuisine, Shunpanro, is also famous as the site where the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty was concluded. Nevertheless, it is said that the general public still ate fugu, and at that time it was sometimes used as an ingredient in miso soup. After the ban on eating fugu was lifted, the city of Shimonoseki, the site of the ban, developed along with fugu. In the Shimonoseki area, fugu is called \"fuku\" in reference to good luck and fortune, and its sashimi is called \"fuku sashimi. The sashimi is sliced thin enough to be seen through, and is served in a variety of ways, such as \"Kiku-zari,\" which looks like a chrysanthemum flower, and \"Tsuru-zari,\" which resembles a crane.",

There are several origins of the name “fukumen.” In Uwajima, konjac is called “yamafuku,” and for this dish, it is cut into thin strips like noodles, so it is called “fukumen.” Also, there are theories that it got its name because the konjac is completely covered with minced meat, and also because “fukume” means to cut the ingredients into small pieces.It is said to have come to be served as a special occasion dish to represent the four seasons, with the pink minced meat placed on top of the konjac representing spring, the green onion representing summer, the orange tangerine representing autumn, and the white minced meat representing winter.",

Because baking soda is used to make it plump, it is also referred to as “soda candy,” “fukurakan,” and “fukurekan.”It’s said that brown sugar strongly established itself as a sweetener in Kagoshima in the Edo period. It’s believed that the Satsuma domain, rulers of the Ryukyu Kingdom at the time, monopolized the growth of sugarcane and production of brown sugar in the Ryukyu and Amami regions, turning it into a tremendously profitable commodity. Land taxes at the time were paid with the uniquely valuable brown sugar rather than rice, and its monopolization allowed finances to recover quickly. On the other hand, because the islanders had little choice but to prioritize brown sugar production, the regular daily production of food became unsustainable and a critical situation arose called the “brown sugar hell.” Thanks to this history, brown sugar became popular throughout Kagoshima, and various local dishes utilizing brown sugar were born along with that popularization. Among those sweets, “getanha” is another local Kagoshima dish that uses brown sugar.",

It is enjoyed not only in the Owari region but also in the southwestern part of Gifu Prefecture, in the Mino region, and in places like Kisosaki Town in Mie Prefecture.The Kiso Three Rivers are blessed with river fish such as crucian carp, carp, and mullet, making them an important source of protein for the local residents. River fish cuisine has a long history of development in this area. Additionally, the red miso (miso made from soybeans) used in \"Funa Miso\" is a representative seasoning of Aichi Prefecture. This miso is created by cultivating koji mold on soybeans, producing koji from the soybeans, and then fermenting and aging the soybean koji for an extended period. The fermentation and aging process lasts for at least one year and can extend to two or three years, resulting in a rich, complex flavor profile with a deep umami, acidity, and a unique astringency. One well-known brand of this type of miso is widely recognized as Haccho Miso.The use of red miso helps eliminate the specific odor of river fish, enhancing the umami flavor in the Funa Miso dish.",

It is called nare-zushi because the fish becomes \"acclimated\" or \"ripe\" as fermentation progresses. Nare-zushi is a method of processing fish for long-term preservation, and is an excellent preservation method because it allows easily perishable fish to be fermented and eaten throughout the year. In Shiga Prefecture, crucian carp, Japanese carp, lotus root, moroko, ayu, hai, loach, carp, loach, and other fish are made into nare-zushi. Funazushi is a typical example, and is often offered as a sacred dish at festivals held at shrines to pray for fertility. Funa-zushi is often made from nigorobuna (crucian carp) caught in Lake Biwa. The whole crucian carp is marinated, and the lactic acid produced during fermentation softens the bones, making it possible to eat all the way down to the bones. The increased lactic acid bacteria also have a beneficial effect on the intestinal tract and are highly nutritious. In Shiga Prefecture, there is a long-standing custom of eating funa-zushi instead of medicine when suffering from stomachaches or poor health. Nare-zushi, which has been popular since ancient times, was selected as one of Shiga Prefecture's Intangible Folk Cultural Assets in 1998.",

Although fish and shellfish of unusual shapes and sizes can be caught here, an alternative source of protein was needed during the off-season in winter. One such fish that was valued as a wintertime protein source was crucian carp, a river fish. It is the most common freshwater fish caught in Saga Prefecture, and is often caught in the creeks of Shiraishi and the Saga Plain, as well as in rivers. Farmers, in particular, catch crucian carp when draining rice paddies in the fall to dry them for long-term preservation. A famous local dish using crucian carp is \"funankogui. Also called funanokogui, this dish consists of crucian carp wrapped in kelp and slowly simmered with seasonal vegetables such as radish, and is softened so that it can be eaten right down to the bones. It is loved as a local delicacy because of its unique flavor and lack of fishy smell. It is always served on special occasions throughout Saga Prefecture, and when it is prepared at home, it is customary to make a large pot of it and distribute it to neighbors. In Kashima City, there is a custom of offering funankogui to Ebisu-sama on January 20, the 20th day of the New Year, to pray for a good catch, prosperous business, and family safety. According to some accounts, the sea bream offered to Ebisu-sama was too expensive for the common people to afford, so they used crucian carp, which is similar in shape, to make up for it, or crucian carp was used instead of fish that could not be caught in the Ariake Sea in winter. In addition, a \"funa-ichi\" (funa market) has been held for more than 300 years on the 20th day of the New Year, where fresh live funa are sold as ingredients for \"funankogui\".",

Thanks to this, wheat production flourished and “funayaki” is cheap to make, which is why it has been so widely consumed across the Chikugo region.It is said that the “funa” in funayaki comes from the Japanese word “fune,” which means ship, and this is because the discs were originally cooked in large pans with curved bottoms, so that when you folded the funayaki in half, it looked like a ship.

The fan-shaped land created by the Kiso River has large grains of sand and good drainage, making it suitable for the cultivation of root crops that grow underground, and the production of daikon radish flourished.Three types of daikon are certified as traditional vegetables of Aichi Prefecture: the sweet Miyashige daikon, which is representative of Owari; the Koryo daikon, which is grown mainly in Ama City and is often used in stewed dishes; and the Moriguchi daikon, which is used for pickles, with the longest growing over 180cm. The \"Aokubu Daikon\" commonly seen in supermarkets is said to have its roots in \"Miyashige Daikon,\" and the \"Koryo Daikon\" is said to have its roots in \"Nerima Daikon,\" which is famous in the Kanto region.Since the area is famous for its daikon, daikon dishes are also very popular. In addition to \"miso oden,\" \"furofuki daikon\" is also popular. The miso sauce for \"furofuki daikon\" in Aichi Prefecture is made with soybean miso (red miso), which is also an indispensable ingredient in the food of Aichi Prefecture.

The key to making \"futatabi dango\" lies in this process, which is also the origin of its name. In the usual process of making dango, the dough is kneaded only once, but in \"Futatabi-dango,\" the dough is first kneaded and then kneaded again. The resulting dough is very soft and fluffy. Finally, the dough is filled with a special sweet bean paste and sprinkled with soybean flour. The \"Futatabi Dango,\" fragrant with fresh mugwort, is a bright, young grass color.Yawami\" used for dango is a dango flour blended with glutinous rice flour and Kamishinko, which makes dango softer in texture than regular dango flour.",

During the Edo period, Funabashi City prospered as a post town along the major transportation route, boosting their agricultural and fishing industry. The fresh seafood caught in Funabashi Bay was even offered to the shogun’s clan. In particular, asari clams were abundant, meaty, and incredibly delicious. Since there were no refrigeration facilities back then, the fishermen steamed the asari before transporting them. The broth created from steaming the clams was mixed with a small amount of miso (miso was expensive and precious at that time) and consumed by the fishermen. This is said to be the origin of Fuukashi. The dish emerged due to the abundance of seafood in the region.(During the Heisei era, the availability of asari gradually declined. Currently, clam digging shores in the prefecture are maintained by importing juvenile clams from foreign countries.)",

In northern Fukuoka Prefecture, the local word for “turtle” or “soft-shelled turtle” is “game”, and the leaves of the sankira plant resemble the shell of the turtle. This is why the snack is also called “game-no-ha” (turtle leaf) or “sankira manju”. Interestingly, the name “sultry rose” is also used to describe the plant, due to its thorny vines, round leaves, and roots, which monkeys even enjoy.",

Nowadays, chicken is generally used instead of suppon, and game-ni is also a New Year's dish and a vegetarian dish, and has become an indispensable local delicacy. According to a national survey, Fukuoka City's high consumption of chicken and burdocks is said to be due to the fact that they are used in \"game-ni.Game-ni\" is also called \"Chikuzen-ni\" in Japan, but while boneless chicken is also used in Chikuzen-ni, boned chicken is sometimes used in Game-ni.",

Although Kagoshima Prefecture is blessed with a mild climate, most of the prefecture, with the exception of Mount Kirishima, is on the Shirasu Plateau, which is very well drained, but is prone to crop damage caused by frequent typhoons. Because of this background, the cultivation of sweet potatoes, which are easy to grow even in barren soil and grow underground, and are therefore less vulnerable to typhoon damage, has taken strong root in Kagoshima Prefecture. There are many theories about the introduction of sweet potatoes, but Tanegashima Hisamoto, the lord of Tanegashima Island, sent some people on an errand to Ryukyu in 1698 and brought back sweet potatoes. Later, in 1705, Maeda Riemon, a sailor from Yamakawa, cultivated sweet potatoes in his own field and distributed them to his neighbors; then they became popular and spread throughout Kagoshima Prefecture. There was a time when they were called \"Koukou imo (filial piety sweet potatoes)\" because they had large yields and were the best food for the poor. Kurobuta pork, which is a specialty product of Kagoshima Prefecture, is known to be raised with sweet potatoes mixed in its feed. Sweet potato shochu, which is a spirit made from sweet potatoes, is also a specialty of Kagoshima. In short, sweet potatoes are an important ingredient in supporting the food culture of Kagoshima Prefecture. Therefore, there are many local dishes using sweet potatoes. One of them is \"Gane\". “Gane” is a dish in which sweet potatoes and vegetables are cut into thick strips, dipped in a batter and fried. It was named so because it looks like a crab (called \"gane\" in Kagoshima dialect). It is characterized by a sweet taste with a lot of sugar, and the ingredients and batter vary from region to region.",

At the same time, it is a “fishing prefecture” as the offshore area is a rich fishing ground where the Oyashio and Kuroshio currents intersect, and a variety of seafood is landed each season. “Garigari Namasu”, a local dish made in Ibaraki Prefecture, which is blessed with rich food materials, is made with the seasonal produce of the mountains and sea. Like common Namasu, “Garigari Namasu” is a dish of finely chopped seafood and vegetables and seasoned with vinegar-based seasonings, but its distinctive feature is the cooking utensils. As the name “Garigari Namasu” implies, daikon (Japanese radish) is roughly grated with a rasping noise (“Gari gari”) using a utensil called \"onioroshi\". The \"onioroshi\" is a bamboo grater with sharp teeth. Its name comes from the fact that its teeth bring up the image of an oni (ogre)'s teeth. Many households in areas where “Garigari Namasu” is eaten have their own onioroshi. Since it is made of bamboo, heat is not easily transferred to the ingredient and it is grated more coarsely than normal daikon oroshi (grated Japanese radish), so it is possible to grate it while retaining the moisture and texture of the ingredients. “Garigari Namasu” is eaten throughout the prefecture, but it is often eaten on a day of celebration in the paddy field region of southern Ibaraki Prefecture.",

Additionally, wheat is also mainly grown in the crop rotation of the rice paddies located at the river basin of the Chikuma river. Rice is so precious that it cannot be eaten everyday at home. As a result, since times past, in order to economize, wheat has played a vital role in daily meals, being milled into flour and used in dishes known as “flour foods.” Among these flour foods one referred to as senbei or usuyaki, where flour is mixed with water and cut vegetables then fried, is often made for okobiru/okobire, or brunch, or children’s afternoon snack. Okobiru is an inflection of kohiru, meaning “late-morning,” and is a sort of in-between meal. It was made as something that could be filling to eat in between the labor of farmwork. The senbei are filled with seasonal vegetables like garlic chives, eggplants, onions, or others; however garlic chives are easy to grow, and aside from a snow-heavy winter, can be harvested anytime so every house has them planted in part of their garden to use at their convenience. It’s said the senbei made with the tender garlic chives that shoot up at the start of spring have an exceptional flavor. The recipes for garlic chive senbei or usuyaki also differ slightly between households, with many variations; like mixing in miso with the flour and vegetables when frying, or eating with a miso or soy based dipping sauce.In the past to save oil, a heated earthenware pan would be greased with silk wadding soaked in oil, then the wheat flour batter poured in. Once fried it would be cut into portions of suitable size and eaten.",

The islanders, on the other hand, were forced to prioritize the production of brown sugar, which made it impossible for them to produce food on a daily basis, creating a harsh situation known as \"brown sugar hell. This history has led to the spread of brown sugar on the Kagoshima mainland, and with it, the birth of various local dishes made with brown sugar. It is thought that \"Getanha\" was born from this background as a confectionery using brown sugar, and became popular among the general public.",

There are many theories as to the origin of the name \"Gohei\"; some say it was created in the shape of a \"gohei” (ritual wand with pleated paper), an offering to the gods; others say it originated as a portable food for mountain workers; and still others say it originated from a man named \"Gohei\" who would spread miso on his rice balls and roast them over a fire when he ate his lunch.",

Eventually, gohei-mochi came to be offered to the gods to pray for safe work in the mountains, and was also used as offerings and eaten at harvest celebrations and other festive occasions.It is generally held that the name was derived from its resemblance in shape to a gohei, a small oval shaped paper money offered to the gods, but there is also a theory that it was first served to soldiers by a Mino native named Gohei during the Battle of Kawanakajima between Shingen Takeda and Kenshin Uesugi in the mid-16th century.",

Sesame is an extremely nutritious food that was once considered to be a valuable medicine in China. It is said that Kobo Daishi, who traveled to China as an envoy to the Tang Dynasty, brought sesame back to Mount Koya and began cultivating it in Japan. Buddhist cuisine, which does not include meat or fish, tends to lack protein, and as a result, it is believed that people adhering to a diet consisting of Buddhist cuisine supplemented their diet by eating sesame, which contains high quality protein.Sesame tofu was later conceived as an efficient way of consuming the nutrients contained in sesame. The skin is removed from raw sesame seeds without roasting and mixed with Yoshino arrowroot and water from Mount Koya. The mixture is then ground with a mortar and pestle and cooked. There is also an alternative theory that sesame tofu has its origins in “ma tofu”, a dish described in “Japanese and Chinese Buddhist Cuisine” published in 1697.During the Showa period, sesame tofu gained widespread recognition as a Mount Koya specialty, and today it is one of the staple dishes of Japanese cuisine.",

It's also referred to as \"Gonbe\" due to the similarity of daikon to a grater (\"gonbe\" in Japanese), and is sometimes known as \"Gonjinamasu.\" In some regions, it's called \"babakoroshi,\" a unique name suggesting it's so delicious it could make grandmothers speechless. While the common ingredients are smashed soybeans and daikon, variations include the addition of taro, aburaage (fried tofu), carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and various seasonings like sugar and mirin. The dish has different names and recipes depending on the region and household.It's worth noting that \"smashed soybeans\" refer to soybeans soaked in water, softened, and then smashed with tools like a wooden mallet before being dried for preservation. This versatile ingredient is not only used in Gonza but also in other dishes like soybean soup, pickles, and stir-fries. In Fukui Prefecture, it remains a common household food. Originally, Gonza was traditionally prepared during the \"Hounkou\" (a major annual event in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism) gatherings, mainly attended by men. It was also created as a unique dish when people got tired of the usual daikon dishes. It is also served as refreshments when neighbors come to take a bath.

The small sardines with very little fat which were suitable for \"gosaitzuke\" were called “Kosai,” which later changed to “gosai.” Other than that, there are also various theories that it’s called \"gosaitzuke\" because it’s pickled by the second wife (gosai; gosaitzuke) or because it uses five ingredients (gosai).In the past each household had its own flavor of \"gosaitzuke\" and it was wildly popular, but in recent years the number of households making \"gosaitzuke\" has been decreasing due to the amount of time and effort involved in making it, and because the traditional way of making it cannot be used due to global warming.

It thrives in the seas influenced by warm currents, and several tons are caught annually in the Tango waters. However, most of the Hamo consumed in Kyoto comes from the Seto Inland Sea or the Genkai Sea.Resembling eels or conger eels in shape, some Hamo can reach almost 2 meters in length. The larger ones are often over ten years old. These fish hide in sandy mud bottoms or rocky holes during the day and become active at night, favoring a diet of fish, shrimp, and crabs. With sharp teeth and a fierce temperament, Hamo may continue to move violently and even bite after being caught. Despite this ferocious appearance, the flesh is beautifully white with a delicate flavor.Preparing Hamo can be challenging due to its numerous small bones, but it has become an integral part of Kyoto's cuisine, largely because the resilient Hamo could be transported live to Kyoto from faraway places.Chefs use a unique technique called \"honekiri\" (bone cutting) to deal with the problematic small bones during cooking. Mastering this method requires skill, and it is often said that a Kyoto chef isn't fully trained until they have learned it.Though it's unclear when Hamo consumption began, a compilation from the latter part of the Edo period titled \"Hamu hyakuchin\" (Sea Eel Hundred Rarities) lists over 100 Hamo dishes. Traditional dishes such as blanched hamo no otoshi, shabu-shabu, sashimi, and others are still enjoyed today, with grilled Hamo being a standard offering.",

Miso soup is so nutritious that it is said to keep the doctor away, and a bowl of miso soup a day was a source of energy throughout the day, just as it is today. By adding lots of ingredients such as radish, carrots, taro, green onions, and fried tofu, you can fill your stomach and efficiently get the nutrients from vegetables. “Suiton” has also long been a popular food in areas where wheat can be grown. Because the wheat flour dough is pulled and torn into pieces, suiton is also called “hinnobe (pull and stretch)” and “tochanage (grab and throw)” around Nagano City and Suzaka City. There are many different ways to knead the flour, levels of hardness, and shapes, and each person has their own preferences. Also, if you mix in pastes such as mugwort or pumpkin, you can create fancy dishes. In Nagano Prefecture, they take care to use seasonal vegetables and ingredients as a foundation, and it is not a matter of just adding anything. Roots are in season in winter (radish, burdock, carrots, potatoes, etc.).Recently, gudakusan miso soup has been attracting attention for its various health benefits. One of these is \"reducing salt.\" In a typical miso soup, the amount of miso and salt per bowl is 12g and 1.5g, but if you make gudakusan miso soup, the umami of the ingredients will be added. Thus, the amount of miso can be reduced to 10g, the amount of soup can be reduced, and the amount of salt can be reduced to 1.2g. In addition, gudakusan miso soup is said to be the best way to get a large amount of phytochemicals such as lycopene, polyphenols, and isoflavones. Nagano Prefecture is said to have many healthy people who live long lives, and it is believed that the secret to this is gudakusan miso soup.",

Originally, six ingredients were used to represent six kanji characters of the Buddhist invocation, “Namu Amidabutsu”. Today, a variety of foodstuffs are used. It is called \"Oguru\" in the Noichi area of Konan City. In Tosa City, when there are nine ingredients to be simmered, it is called “Itokoni”. The ingredients that are similar in genre, such as daikon, carrot, and burdock, or taro, konnyaku, and tofu, are likened to \"itoko (cousins)\". When three similar ingredients \"itoko (cousins)\" are there, it is called \"Itokoni\".

Yokohama, which opened as a port city in 1859, was quick to embrace Western culture, leading to the early spread of meat-eating culture within the country. Inspired by the beef dishes consumed by foreigners residing in the international settlement near Yokohama Port, the owner of the izakaya (Japanese pub) \"Isekuma\" opened the first beef hot pot restaurant in 1862. At that time, many people in Japan were averse to eating beef, and \"Isekuma\" faced strong opposition from the owner's wife, resulting in the restaurant being divided into half izakaya and half beef hot pot. However, by seasoning the unfamiliar beef in a way that suited Japanese tastes, it became popular, eventually evolving into a dedicated beef hot pot establishment. Other beef hot pot restaurants followed suit, and today, long-established restaurants from the Meiji era continue to operate. Beef hot pot has become a renowned specialty dish in Yokohama.",

Due to its seeds, known as \"korobi,\" yielding tung oil (kiri-abura), the cultivation of Aburagiri was encouraged in Japan. Tung oil was valuable and used for various purposes, including lamp oil, water repellent for Japanese umbrellas, and as a raw material for candles.Especially in the Obama region, Aburagiri cultivation was thriving. By the late 17th century, it was cultivated in almost every village, and by the late 19th century, it boasted the highest production volume nationwide. The leaves of Aburagiri have a greasy surface, making rice less likely to stick to them and imparting a distinctive aroma. Due to its excellent preservability, the leaves were ideal for wrapping sushi, earning them the local nickname \"sushi no happa\" or \"sushi leaves,\" and were planted in many households as a way to prolong the freshness of sushi.This tradition persists today, and you can still observe Aburagiri trees in gardens and fields, reflecting the wisdom of past generations in preserving sushi for as long as possible.",

Yellowtail is a fish that changes its name according to its size, from yazu to inada, hamachi, and finally yellowtail, and is used in dishes for festive occasions. One of them is that in Hakata, there was a custom to bring one large yellowtail to the bride's hometown at the end of the year, saying \"Yome-san bururi ga good\" (the bride's bururi is good). It is said that this led to its use as an ingredient in New Year's osechi (New Year's dishes) and zoni. And \"Hakata Zoni\" is a unique way of cooking, in which the ingredients are prepared one by one on bamboo skewers, just like oden.In fact, the history of Fukuoka is deeply related to the background of the creation of this cooking style. Fukuoka has long been known as a town of Hakata merchants, and the existence of \"Goryon-san\" supported these merchants. Goryon-san is derived from the honorific title \"Goryonin\" for the wife of a nobleman, and the ladies of Hakata merchants are called \"Goryon-san. Merchant families, busy with many visitors and business, could not afford to take the time to prepare zoni. So they came up with the idea of skewering the ingredients one by one in advance. Then all that is left to do is to remove the ingredients from the skewers, place them in bowls, and pour the dashi broth over them. This is an idea from the busy Goryon-san.",

    "history": "“Hakozushi” can be found all over Japan. It is a type of sushi made by filling a square wooden box with sushi rice, placing the ingredients on top, and then pressing them down from above. The history of \"Hakozushi\" is older than that of nigirizushi. It started with “Narezushi”, which is made by marinating fish, rice, and salt for a long period of time, and by the Muromachi period (1336-1573), “Hannare” appeared, which is made to mature in a relatively short period of time. Compared to “Narezushi”, “Hannare” retains the texture of both the fish and the rice, so the sour rice itself becomes more palatable. From this trend, the prototype of “Hakozushi” was born, which consisted of putting salted fish and rice in a sushi tub or wooden box, covering the lid, placing a weight on top, and letting it ferment for several days. Later, with the invention of kasuzu (sake-lees vinegar), \"Hakozushi\" with a variety of ingredients was created in many places. In the past, when there was not enough rice available, \"Hakozushi\" which required large amounts of rice, was a great luxury. “Hakozushi”, which is mainly eaten in the Owari and Nishimikawa areas, is also called “Kirizushi”, and is characterized by the diagonal arrangement of ingredients such as shrimp, conger, dried shiitake mushrooms and thin strips of egg. This was designed to ensure that everyone can enjoy a variety of flavors equally. The box is a special wooden one with five or six tiers stacked on top of each other. Stack the wooden box with the sushi rice and ingredients and wedge it together from the side to apply pressure. Many families used to have wooden boxes, but nowadays the number is decreasing.",

It is a convenient dish for weddings, funerals, and other occasions that was devised by busy women engaged in household chores and farming. In spring, it is called \"botamochi,\" and in autumn, it is called \"ohagi,\" but they are essentially the same thing. In addition to the classic adzuki beans and roasted soybean flour (kinako), there are variations that generously sprinkle egoma (perilla seeds) or walnuts. The Ueda region, which receives little rainfall, is suitable for cultivating walnuts, making it a high-quality walnut-producing area. Ohagi, eaten with a walnut sauce seasoned with soy sauce and sugar, has become a specialty in the city of Tomi. There is an old saying that goes, \"Thunder from afar and botamochi next door are things that seem to come but never do,\" expressing the desire to share this dish. Red adzuki beans have long been believed to have the power to ward off evil, and they have always been used in celebratory meals.",

It appears in the Kamigata rakugo \"Yusanbune\" and it's thought that even the general population from ancient times were familiar with this dish.The eel's head is called Hansuke. There are various theories surrounding its origin, such as one strainer of eel's head used to be sold for 50 sen (1／2 yen), so it came to be called Hansuke (han meaning half) of one yen (called ensuke). Another theory is that a man named Hansuke sold the head of eels as well.In Osaka, when making kabayaki (grilled eel), the eel is grilled with a sauce and the body cut open, while the head is attached. The head is then removed after grilling. Although the head is cut off, it was most likely still a food for sale at low price because the flavor of the sauce was already soaked in. When hansuke is stewed with tofu and green onions in a dashi soup stock, an even richer and deeper dashi stock is made that is incredibly delicious. You can even enjoy the small amount of meat from the Hansuke.Hansuke tofu, which makes use of an eel head that is otherwise thrown away, represents a dish that offers a glimpse into the Osaka spirit of \"Shimatsu no ryori,\" where ingredients are used in a zero waste manner.",

The sandfish come to the shores of Shonai around December to lay their eggs. For this reason, the sight of fisherman congregating on Sakatakita Pier and other such places is a characteristic winter scene.The size of the Japanese sandfish catch declined precipitously from around the end of the Showa period until the Heisei period. However, as a result of a joint effort by Yamagata Prefecture’s fisherman to institute fishing limits and manage resources, the size of the sandfish catch is now on an upswing. Japanese sandfish will rush toward shallow water in large groups when the sea is rough and thunder sounds. For this reason, they are also known as “thunder fish.”“Poached Japanese sandfish” is a simple dish: poach the fish in a pot, splash on soy sauce or the like, and eat. The dish has a light flavor and is a go-to choice for cooking with sandfish. There are a wide variety of ways to cook with sandfish: in addition to poaching, it can be, among other things, fried, dried, or simmered with sauce. The Japanese sandfish is deeply connected to traditional events of the Shonai region. “During a celebration of the deity Daikoku-sama”, an event which takes places on December 9, there is an ongoing custom of eating sandfish with a miso glaze.",

As is typical of Akita, a rice-producing region, hata-hata sushi, made with rice and plenty of malted rice, is an essential part of Akita's food culture among hata-hata dishes. There are slight differences in the method of preparation depending on the region. The method of immediately marinating hatahata in salt has been handed down from generation to generation. The method of soaking the grouper in water for a while to remove the sliminess and blood before processing it is a method that produces grouper sushi with a clean taste and no odor, with just the right amount of sweetness from the malted rice.

In the Tome region, which was one of the Date clan's major rice-producing areas, farmers were unable to eat enough rice to satisfy their needs because rice was given to the clan after the annual tribute was paid under the \"rice purchase\" system. In addition to barley rice, farmers in their wisdom turned wheat from their fields into flour, kneaded it into a paste, boiled it, and ate it as \"hatto. At first, \"hatto\" was a substitute for rice, but over the years, it became a tastier and more popular food. However, the lords who ruled the Tome region were concerned that the farmers might neglect rice cultivation, and they began to prohibit the consumption of this dish except on special occasions, hence the name \"hatto\".The soup stock and ingredients used for Hatto soup vary from region to region and from household to household, even within the Tome region. The soup stock is made from dried bonito flakes and dried sardines, and the ingredients include seasonal vegetables, mushrooms, chicken, and pork, and the taste has been passed down from mother to son for generations.Even today, hatto soup is served at local events throughout the four seasons.",

They then use the marker to follow the bees and find their hive. These bees used to nest in paddies, but they now nest in the mountains due to the effects of pesticides.When competitions for the heaviest hebo nests were held, hebo nests would be dug up and placed in nesting boxes in early summer.

In fact, the 1802 encyclopedia \"Shaping Illustrations\" compiled by Shigehisa Shimazu describes luffa cuisine. Luffa belongs to the Cucurbits family and is native to tropical Asia. It thrives in hot and humid weather, which is why it is mostly grown in Okinawa Prefecture and southern Kyushu in Japan. Its high fiber content earned it the nickname “ito-uri” (sponge gourd) and later it was abbreviated to “to-uri”. And since “to” is in between “he” and “chi” in the Iroha order (traditional order of the Japanese syllabary), it came to be called “hechima” (meaning between the “he” and “chi”). For food, a variety with less developed fibers is grown. The fruits are harvested when they are young, less than 20 cm in length, to prevent the fibers from becoming tough.

The entrails of the fish are removed and pickled in salt, and the fish is then preserved for a long time without spoiling. It was a valuable source of protein for surviving the harsh winters. It has a long history and is said to have already been produced in the middle of the Edo period. There are several theories as to how it came to be called heshiko. One theory is that the word \"heshiko\" was derived from \"heshikomushi,\" which is an abbreviation of \"heshikomushi\" when fishermen marinated fish in a barrel, and another that the word \"heshiko\" was derived from \"hishio,\" the water that came out after fish were pickled in salt. Heshiko is also made from sardines, squid, and pufferfish, but mackerel is the most common. Seafood caught in Wakasa was transported to Kyoto via the \"Wakasa Kaido\" (Wakasa Highway), which in recent years has come to be known as the \"Saba Kaido\" because it was used mainly to transport salted mackerel to Kyoto among many other types of seafood.In the Reinan region, \"Konuka Iwashi\" (pickled sardines) is often eaten, which is mainly made by pickling sardines.",

For example, the fishing industry in Kyoto Prefecture is wide-ranging, including fixed net fishing, offshore trawling, small boat trawling, shellfish farming, and longline fishing. A variety of seafood can be caught, such as snow crab, egg cockle, and amberjack. The fishermen have a custom of drying the seasonal fish they catch to use at home, and this is a tradition that continues to this day. Dried fish, dried sardines, and dried seaweed are well known as Tango specialties.\"Heshiko\" is eaten throughout the Tango area, especially in the town of Ine. \"Heshiko\" is a preserved food made by pickling fish such as mackerel and sardines in rice bran and salt for a long period of time. There are various theories about the origin of the name, such as that fishermen referred to the act of pickling fish in a barrel as \"heshikomu,\" which was then shortened to \"heshiko.\"\"Heshiko\" is richer in umami than raw mackerel before it is processed. The unique flavor and saltiness go well with rice and alcoholic drinks. The \"heshiko\" made in Ine uses domestic, Canadian, or Norwegian mackerel, which contain a lot of fat.",

Foxtail millet (hie) is a type of cereal native to Japan that has been consumed since pre-Jomon times. Its tough outer husk allows it to be stored for extended periods, making it valuable. In slash-and-burn agriculture, it is cultivated alongside millet in the second year. One of the effects of consuming foxtail millet is that it warms the body, making it suitable for the Japanese people's constitution and climate. While \"hie meshi\" is fragrant when hot, its flavor diminishes when it cools. However, compared to other grains, it provides better satiety.In Shiiha Village, located in the mountainous region, hunting is still prevalent. A porridge called \"hie zushi\" is made by boiling rice, foxtail millet, wild boar meat, intestines, and vegetables in a broth made from boiled bone-in wild boar meat.",

Fishing for hokki-gai has been conducted in the waters off Soma and Futaba since the Meiji era (1868-1912), and the area has long been known as a famous producer of hokki-gai. The mineral-rich seawater off the coast of Soma and Futaba influences the growth of hokki-gai, allowing them to be caught relatively large, with a sweet taste and soft texture.A local dish made by combining these two specialties is \"hokkimeshi.

The seafood is seasoned only with salt and then steamed and roasted, resulting in a simple yet splendid and grandiose dish. The deliciously tender texture of the roasted seafood is truly addictive.It is said that during the Muromachi period, this dish was eaten by pirates to celebrate their victories in battles. Imabari City, known as the base of the Murakami pirates (navy) which were stationed in the Kurushima Strait, is the origin of this dish, hence it is sometimes referred to as \"pirate cuisine. The term \"pirate\" might evoke images of lawless plunderers, but during peacetime, they played crucial roles as sea guides, coast guards, and facilitators of maritime trade and transportation in the Seto Inland Sea. During times of war, they skillfully operated small fast boats and excelled in combat using gunpowder, such as the \"hōraku hiya\" (fire arrow). It is also said that they were cultured group who not only enjoyed tea and incense but also composed poetry.

The fruit is left to ripen on the trees until they become a deep red color. The texture is crunchy, but the fruit is very juicy. This Onsen Bijin is not produced in large quantities and only 50 to 60 boxes of this fruit are made per year, which makes them rare.Another brand, “Kyara Gaki”, can only be grown on trees with an age between 50 to 100 years. The persimmons grown on these old trees are sweeter than ordinary persimmons and has been gifted to the Imperial Household Agency in the past. In autumn, many persimmons are left out to dry like orange curtains and this is scenic to the region.In such Saga Prefecture, \"kaki noren\" (=persimmon curtains) have become an autumn tradition.Dried persimmons are made by hand, one by one. The skin of the sour persimmon is peeled and then the fruit is tied with a piece of string and hung from a high place such as under eaves. They are called \"kaki-Noren\" (persimmon curtains) because the rows of dried persimmons look like orange curtains hanging down, particularly around Mount Sefuri and Mount Tenzan. This tradition has been around for around 300 years.The temperature in the areas surrounded by the mountains have extreme ranges, which make the climate ideal for making dried persimmons. The dried persimmons are soft and chewy and are very popular. Dried persimmons can be eaten as is,They can also be eaten for cooking, such as to make “Hoshigaki Namasu”. \"Namasu\" is eaten as one of the New Year's osechi dishes, and this \"Hoshigaki Namasu\" is indispensable in the Matsuume area of Daiwa-cho, Saga City, where dried persimmons have been produced for many years.",

As the cultivation of sweet potatoes spread in Shizuoka Prefecture, a man named Shozo Kuribayashi came up with the idea of boiling sweet potatoes, cutting them into thin slices with a knife, and then drying them. This is said to have been the beginning of \"dried taro.\" Because of its convenience in that it could be eaten at any time and preserved, it quickly spread to the Kanto region.Later, Terunuma Kantaro, who was lost off the coast of Shizuoka Prefecture, began making dried shiitake in Ibaraki Prefecture from the dried shiitake he had seen in Shizuoka Prefecture. Then, it is said that production of dried taro increased dramatically when Toshichi Yuasa and Kihei Koike, who ran a rice cracker shop in Nakaminato City (present-day Hitachinaka City), began to produce and sell dried taro. At Horide Shrine in Ajigaura, there is a bust of Kibei as the person who popularized \"dried sweet potatoes.Production of dried taro practically stopped after the war, when sweet potatoes replaced other staple foods, but was revived after the war with the encouragement of the prefectural government.",

Due to the deep snowy environment where the sun-dried daikon radishes for making takuan (sweet dumplings) would drop below freezing without being sufficiently dried, the daikon radishes were dried on the hearth of the house. The heat and smoke from the hearth fire enhanced the preservation of the daikon, and by soaking them in rice bran and salt to remove the moisture, the daikon could be eaten over the winter. In addition, the winter temperatures slow fermentation, and the smoked aroma on the daikon and the pickled ingredients fuse with each other with a good salinity, creating a unique umami and flavor. This takuan pickles dried over an open hearth is said to be the prototype of iburigakko, which originated in the Muromachi period (1333-1573) and was produced in almost every household in this area.

In the Nishi-Mikawa region it’s customary to eat “Igamanju\" during the Doll’s Festival (Momo no Sekku).“Igamanju” is a confection made by coating either coarse or fine red bean paste in rice flour and then decorating the surface with colored glutinous rice. While “Igamanju” can also be found outside of Aichi Prefecture in Kyoto and Kyushu, it’s a unique custom of the Nishi-Mikawa region to eat “Igamanju” as part of the Girls' Day (Hinamatsuri) celebration.There are various theories about the origin of the name “Igamanju.” Some believe that the glutinous rice used on the surface of the confection resembles the texture of a chestnut (“iga” in Japanese). Another theory suggests that it comes from the historical event of Ieyasu Tokugawa’s journey known as “Iga-goe,” which means crossing the Iga region. Yet another theory links the name to the aroma (“kaori” in Japanese) that emanates while steaming the manju, as it is derived from the word (\"ii no ka”) which means the fragrance of rice.The “igamanju” you can eat in Okazaki City is made of pink, yellow, and green. Some say that the pink means peach blossoms, yellow means rape flower blossoms, and green means new buds. Others say the pink (red) means warding off evil, yellow means prayers for a good harvest, and green means vitality. Some suggest that this vivid and colorful appearance is one of the reasons it has become established as a traditional Girls' Day confection.",

A few decades ago, azuki bean paste was added to the filling, and it has become a mainstream item because of its popularity with the sweetness of the azuki bean paste and the saltiness of the dough, which goes well with the crunchy sweet potatoes.

The red soil plateau makes it easy to cultivate sweet potatoes, and the sweet flavor of the harvested produce makes it a daily dietary staple, often replacing rice. The ingenuity of using fewer glutinous rice to make mochi from sweet potatoes played a role in its popularity.Sweet potato cultivation in the Kumano region started during the Edo period. Umematsu Yasuke, a resident of Kushimoto, discovered the deliciousness of sweet potatoes during a visit to Hyuga in Kyushu and brought them back to Kushimoto. The climate and conditions of Kii Province (now Wakayama Prefecture) proved suitable for sweet potato cultivation, leading to widespread adoption in various parts of the southern part of the prefecture. During that time, sharing seedlings or cultivation methods outside the domain was prohibited to protect the domain's interests. Umematsu Yasuke, who brought sweet potatoes to the distant southern region of the prefecture, was posthumously honored, receiving recognition from the Governor of Wakayama Prefecture during the Meiji period.Apart from \"imomochi\" (sweet potato rice cake), there are other local dishes using sweet potatoes, such as \"ukeja\" (sweet potato with tea), \"imochagayu\" (sweet potato rice porridge), \"imogohan\" (sweet potato rice), and \"yude hoshiimo\" (boiled dried sweet potatoes).",

Sweet potatoes were substituted in place of rarely grown glutinous rice, and a unique sweet rice ball culture was created.While at first the imobota looks like any other sweet rice ball, you can see the slight yellow in the cracks of the bean paste, and once eaten the sweetness of the potatoes spreads out from the rice, something unique to sweet rice balls.",

However, at that time there was no way to communicate to announce the arrival of a boat, so the boatmen had to wait for days before the consignee showed up, and they would hold a party around a pot on the riverbank to pass the time. As there was a village called Koshio near the pier, which was famous for taro production, they would cook taro and dried cod from the cargo in a pot and eat them. This is believed to be the root of the present day \"Imoni\". The use of beef started around the beginning of the Showa period (around 1930). The seasoning and ingredients of \"Imoni\" differ from region to region. The Shonai region, which faces the Sea of Japan, is especially unique in that when the tradition of the inland area's Imoni was introduced to the Shonai region, the locals chose pork and miso (which goes well with the pork), because the pig farming industry was active in the region.",

The anchovy catch is hauled to Ibuki Island in a mere 30 minutes before being boiled up. The production of high quality sardines depends on the same suppliers consistently handling everything from catching the fish to processing them. It takes between one and three days for the catch to end up on store counters. The fishermen may prioritize speed, but they also pay meticulous care to their catch. It requires great skill to adjust the amount of fish that enter their nets, so as to avoid damaging the bodies of the fish.The sardines hatched in the peaceful Seto Inland Sea make a rich dashi stock, with a strong umami flavor. Dashi stock made from these sardines is an indispensable part of Kagawa cuisine. It is used in various staples of home cooking, not least in Sanuki udon noodles, a local specialty. The sardine flesh is also often eaten in stewed dishes or tempura, making it one of the foremost ingredients that underpins local cuisine.",

Since long ago, local households had a custom of slaughtering locally raised chickens to serve in a yosenabe hot pot for ceremonial family gatherings, and this is said to be connected to the \"Iriyaki\" of today. However, households by the sea in fishing villages were said to make their hot pot using fish caught in the nearby sea instead of chicken. Today, the basic \"Iriyaki\" recipe has two variations: one with chicken and one with fish. It is called \"Iriyaki\" because when making the hot pot, the chicken or fish are first fried in camellia oil. It is considered to be the same cooking technique as the \"Iriyaki\" that appears in “the Konjaku Monogatari” during the Heian period.",

    "history": "The practice of dolphin fishing in Shizuoka Prefecture has been conducted primarily in the Izu region. The gulfs of the Izu Peninsula serve as migration routes for the dolphins, while the complex geography of the peninsula makes it a suitable location for the dolphin drive fishing method, whereby dolphins are herded and driven into a bay or beach using boats. Dolphin bones found at Jomon period archaeological sites, as well as records from medieval and early modern eras, indicate that dolphin fishing has been practiced since ancient times. Following the Meiji era, dolphins caught in Izu were sold throughout other areas within Shizuoka, as well as to outside prefectures such as Aichi, Gifu, and Yamanashi.Currently, the only organization that continues the tradition of dolphin drive fishing is the Ito Fisheries Cooperative (Ito City, Futo Port). However, due to the intensifying focus, both domestically and internationally, on protecting and conserving dolphin populations, as well as regulations limiting the quantities and types of species allowed to be caught, dolphin fishing has not been conducted since 2004. Nonetheless, drive fishing has been permitted since 2019 for the expressed purposes of capturing dolphins for captive breeding.“Iruka no Miso-ni” is a traditional, local delicacy of Izu. In the past, when dolphin meat was commonly sold at fish stores, it was served regularly in households―stir-fried with burdock roots (gobo), or perhaps other ingredients such as carrots and konnyaku (yam cake), then seasoned with sake, soy sauce, sugar, and miso, and simmered into a stew.",

The fish has a clear body and is quite small, measuring only between 5 cm to 6 cm in length, and belongs to the goby family.The isaza fishing season begins in spring, which is considered the season of the fish. This is because the isaza swim up from the sea to spawn and gather in large numbers in the rivers of Anamizu Town. The traditional fishing method used in the area is called \"Hocho,\" which involves using a four-handed net. This fishing method is still a springtime tradition, and many isaza are caught using this method.The best time to catch isaza is around mid-March. During this time, the fish are eaten live and whole. From April to May, the meat of the isaza grows a little larger, making it perfect for a variety of dishes. It can be used in soups, deep-fried, steamed in a bowl, and more. One of the standard dishes made with isaza is \"simmered isaza with egg.\"In May, the same white croaker fish is caught in the Kaga and Mikawa regions, where it is called \"suberu\" and consumed.",

It is made by stewing root vegetables like burdock, daikon radish, carrots, and taro along with red azuki beans, which are believed to be some of Shinran Shonin’s favorite foods. This stew is rich in nutrients and delicious in cold seasons like fall and winter. The origin of the name “Itokoni” literally means “cousin stew” in Japanese. There are two reasons for this. First, the root vegetables used in the dish are very similar to each other, like cousins. Second, the hardest to stew vegetables are put in the pot first, then gradually the easier to stew vegetables are added. The word “gradually” in Japanese translates to “Oi-oi”, “Oi” in Japanese also means nephew as well, thus making the name “cousin stew” fitting. Another theory is that the name comes from the Buddhist term, “Itoku” which means to benefit from an ancestor’s virtue. Since the dish is used to commemorate the legacy of Shinran Shonin, this theory is also fitting. While the vegetables used can differ from different regions, as well as the use of miso or soy sauce, red azuki beans are always included.

Because okara’s white color results in it sometimes being referred to as “utsugi no hana” (the deutzia crenata flower), it is sometimes called “utsugi no hana pickling”. Being the residue of soybeans produced when making tofu, okara is a healthy food rich in dietary fibers. By pickling food items in okara, it is possible to prevent them from oxidizing and losing their shapes.",

While the Sumitomo family ate sushi made with rice, rice was not easily accessible to the common people. As an alternative to rice, the common people used soy pulp from soybeans cultivated in the space between the rice paddies, trying to replicate the appearance of the Sumitomo family's sushi. This dish became known as \"Izumiya,\" derived from the Sumitomo family's business name, and is said to have spread to the various hometowns of individuals who had worked for the Sumitomo family across the prefecture.

When buckwheat flour is milled, it is generally classified into three types of flour, from the first to the third. For example, soba made from the first buckwheat flour, which is ground from the center of the buckwheat seed, is called Sarashina soba, while soba made from the third buckwheat flour, which is ground from the part closer to the outer shell, is darker in color and is called Yabusoba or Inaka soba.Izumo soba is made using a milling method called \"Hikigurumi,\" in which the buckwheat (the buckwheat with the hull attached) is ground directly into buckwheat flour without sorting. This process is said to produce soba with high nutritional value and aroma, as well as a good flavor and texture. Another feature of soba is that only about 20% of the flour is used to bind the buckwheat.",

Izushi soba is made using the traditional method of freshly ground, freshly beaten, and freshly boiled soba. The small dish on which the soba is served is approximately 13 cm in diameter and is said to have originated around the end of the Edo period when soba was served in a small, shallow, handmade salt dish for easy portability when served at food stalls.

There are many theories as to its origin, such as that Takayama Ukon, a Christian feudal lord, learned it from a missionary and introduced it to the Kaga domain, that Okabe Jibuemon, who served as Toyotomi Hideyoshi's food service officer, introduced it from Korea, and that it was introduced by a wandering Russian. As to the origin of the name \"Jibuni\", there are various theories, including that it is derived from \"Jibu” by Okabe Jibuemon and the onomatopoeic word \"Jibu Jibu” for simmering. Funaki Dennai, known as \"Knife Samurai\", who worked in the kitchen of the Kaga domain, wrote down several dishes and their recipes in his book \"Cuisine Chikara-so\", including \"Jibu Jibuni, Iridori (fried chicken), Yudori (hot water chicken), Noppei (vegetable soup) and Mugidori (wheat chicken)\". The modern \"Jibuni\" is believed to be the recipe for Mugidori in the text passed down. It is said that the name of the dish was changed from Mugidori to \"Jibuni\" for some reason after a long period of time. When about 3,000 retainers were invited to the opening banquet of the Kanaya Goten, a villa of the Kaga domain lord, “Jibuni” with duck, Japanese parsley, sudare-fu and arrowhead were served to the lord.",

Although small in size, it is resistant to disease and is characterized by its white skin and white flesh.

The Atsumi Peninsula is affected by the Kuroshio Current off the coast in its temperate climate, length of daylight hours, and numerous days with good weather; it is an environment extremely suited to agriculture. However, it lacked large rivers in the past; there was consistent drought damage, and the poor soil quality could have hardly been called fertile. From the Showa Period on, once the Toyogawa Canal was developed, agriculture developed rapidly, and it became one of the leading agricultural areas in Japan for vegetables and flowers.Jojokiri is a dish passed down from the Meiji Period to farmers in the Atsumi Peninsula with its flourishing agriculture. It is also called \"Irago shiruko.\" Udon noodles are boiled in a broth sweetened with sugar and eaten. It is said that the dish came to be called \"jojokiri\" from the shape of the thin udon noodles kneaded from flour, which resembles loaches (\"dojo\" or \"jojo\").Because it was eaten in place of a snack during breaks in farm work, it is unique in its sweet finish, since sugar helps relieve tiredness.",

This was a memorable event for Gunma, as the prefecture declared itself “Sports Prefecture Gunma\" and it was the first time that “Gunma-chan” appeared as the mascot. Joshu Kimpira, or stir-fried carrot and burdock root, was invented especially for the event as a new local dish featuring Gunma's famous local products such as pork, shiitake mushrooms, konjac, and so on. One of the characteristics of this dish is to thickly cut the burdock root, which is commonly used in kimpira. This is said to be reminiscent of the magnificent three famous mountains of Jomo. Depending on the region, different variations of the dish may include the addition of chicken, green peppers, freeze-dried tofu, and fried satsuma-age fish cakes, but in any case, it makes abundant use of Gunma's local products and has become a firm favorite on the dinner table of families throughout the prefecture.",

Junjun made with lake fish is mainly eaten around lakes such as the Kohoku region, Kosai region, Koto region, and Okishima.It is said that the name “junjun” comes from the sound that is made when the ingredients are boiled in a pot. It is said that it has long been eaten by simmering isaza gobies, eels, and catfish caught in Lake Biwa with seasonal vegetables.In addition, ingredients such as Omi beef, one of Japan's three major wagyu beef, isaza gobies endemic to Lake Biwa, and Toyoura green onions and Azuchi Nobunaga green onions produced around Azuchi Town, Omihachiman City, where Azuchi Castle was located, go well with junjun and can be eaten even more deliciously. In particular, Toyoura green onions, which are a traditional vegetable of Shiga Prefecture, are produced in small quantities, but have a good flavor and become soft and sweet when heated. On the other hand, Azuchi Nobunaga green onions are thick, and their deep sweetness increases when heated. Both are vegetables that go well with hotpot dishes. In addition, Shiga Prefecture's specialty products such as chojifu and red konjac are also suitable for hotpot dishes. Chojifu is characterized by its square shape, chewy texture, and smooth mouthfeel. Red konjac is dyed red with iron sesquioxide, which is good for one’s health.",

Having an abundant amount of junsai in the pot is the local specialty. \"Junsai\", often called “watershield” in English, grows in freshwater marshes and ponds. It is a perennial aquatic plant and is from the water lily family with round leaves floating on the surface of the water. The bright green leaves grow from spring to summer, and the jelly-like shoots that emerge from the stems are eaten. In Japan, it used to grow wild in many places, and in Akita Prefecture, it was growing wild in \"Kakusuke-numa\" in the town of Mitane. It has been called \"nunawa\" (swamp rope) in the region, because it grows long and thin like a rope in the swamp. People have eaten junsai for a long time, but environmental changes have reduced its native areas. The local people began to cultivate and maintain the \"junsai\" swamp with the passion to save their precious foodstuff. Now, the town of Mitane has become one of the largest producers of \"junsai\" in Japan. Even today, \"junsai\" are carefully hand-picked one by one on a little boat, which has become a summer tradition in the town of Mitane.",

In Aichi Prefecture, it is mainly grown in western Owari, such as Aisai City and Inazawa City, and is also produced in Gifu Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture. It is said that production in the Chubu region began around the Taisho era (1912-1926). In Aisai City, renkon (lotus root) cultivation also flourishes, but since the harvest time of renkon and that of julosasage are different, it is thought that the ability to grow the crop throughout the year may be the reason why julosasage cultivation took root in this region.Beans such as azuki are said to have a skin that cracks when cooked, giving the appearance of seppuku (ritual suicide), and the jurokusage beans, which do not crack even when cooked, were favored by samurai warriors for their good luck.Seeds are sown in February, and around the middle of May, poles and nets are prepared for the vines to crawl on. In summer, the pods are harvested when they are 30 to 50 cm long. The pods are similar to string beans, but are characterized by their very long length. Therefore, it is very time-consuming to harvest them by hand, picking them one by one. The pods are harvested when they are soft and eaten whole.Because of its scarcity, the time-consuming jurokusage is often consumed locally and is a locally produced for local consumption vegetable that is not often distributed outside of the prefecture.When choosing jurokusage, it is best to select long, thin and bright green ones. It is easier to cook than string beans, has a softer texture, and has a light, refreshing flavor.It is used in many dishes such as sesame paste, soaked vegetables, fried vegetables, simmered dishes, and tempura.",

It is a familiar local dish in Ishikawa Prefecture, where it has been passed down from generation to generation since the days of the Kaga Clan, but the western part of Toyama Prefecture was once part of the Kaga Clan and has many similarities with Kaga culture.There are various theories about the origin of the dish, but it is said that it was one of the dishes offered to the lord of the Maeda Clan when he visited Fukaya Onsen (Kanazawa City) for a hot-spring cure, or that it was first eaten by farmers who hid yellowtail, which was only available to samurai at the time, in a turnip so that it would not be found by farmers. The Tonami Plain, which straddles Tonami City and Nanto City, is famous as a production area of turnips, and the cultivation of turnips starts after rice cultivation is finished. Large turnips weighing more than 1 kg are harvested in late October every year. In addition to yellowtail, mackerel, salmon, and trout are also used in Toyama.",

In order to hand down these locally-rooted vegetables to future generations, Kanazawa City has established a certification system for “Kaga vegetables” and is working to popularize and promote them.Kaga vegetables are defined as those which were cultivated before 1945 and are still being cultivated today in Kanazawa City. As of now 15 items are certified, including: Sweet potato, Kaga lotus root, Kaga pickled soybean, purple calyx eggplant, Gensuke daikon radish, and Kanazawa ippon green onion. Among the certified items, especially high-quality (outstanding) vegetables are distributed with a brand seal affixed.Kaga giant cucumber, one of the Kaga vegetables, is mainly produced in Uchigi Town and Kahoku within Kanazawa City. As the name suggests, the fruit is nearly 20cm long and grows to a diameter of 5cm to 6cm. Large ones weigh between 500g and 600g, much heavier than ordinary cucumbers.These cucumbers first appeared in 1936, when a farmer in the Kuan Town area inherited the seeds of short-cut cucumbers from the Tohoku region and started cultivating them. At that time they were similar to gourds, and due to natural crossbreeding over many years the fruit diameter grew rounder and the color changed from yellow to green. It’s said that it took its current form around 1952. Today it has moved from open-field cultivation to greenhouse cultivation, and is shipped not only to the local area, but also to Tokyo and Kansai.Kaga giant cucumbers are used in vinegared dishes and soups, but “Kaga futo kyuri no ankake” is a popular summer staple dish.",

It's said that the poor farmers had an abundant harvest every year after this encounter. Kahou Dango, which came to be prepared in association with this tale, is made by sticking wood pieces from the Hagi plant that resembles \"Kahou\" (karmic retribution), and offering them to a Kamidana (Shinto altar) along with walking sticks and chopsticks made of Hagi. It was an enjoyable dish to children, because it's said that when you happen upon a dango that has a \"Kahou\" wood piece inside, \"karmic retribution is bestowed upon you, which means good luck.” If this \"Kahou\" is offered to a Kamidana (Shinto altar), it is said to turn into money the next morning.Azuki beans were not only a food to eat on special days, but were also seen as convenient and nutritious food source during winter time.",

Hiroshima Prefecture ranks first in the nation in oyster production, accounting for more than half of the nation's total production (according to \"Fishery and Aquaculture Production Statistics\" by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2020). The history of oyster eating in Hiroshima is long, with shells excavated from shell middens indicating that people have been eating wild oysters since the Jomon and Yayoi periods. It is also believed that aquaculture began in the 1500s and 1600s. The bay in this area has all the right conditions for oyster cultivation: calm waves and moderate tidal currents, rivers flowing into the bay creating a layer that dilutes the salt concentration in the seawater during the rainy season and summer, and nutrients flowing into the bay from the Chugoku Mountains.

Poultry farming in Aichi Prefecture has continued to flourish to the present day. As a result, there are many chicken dishes in Aichi Prefecture. In addition to “Tebasaki(chicken wings)\", \"Yakitori\", “Mizutaki\", “Kashiwa no Hikidorizushi (=minced chicken meat)\", and “Torimeshi (=chicken rice)\" are also popular.In the Edo period (1603-1867), chicken meat was so valuable that \"Torimeshi-magai\" was eaten, which did not contain chicken meat. However, as chicken hatching technology was brought to Aichi Prefecture and poultry farming flourished, “Torimeshi\" began to be prepared to enjoy eating adult chickens that no longer laid eggs. Since the meat of adult chickens was tough, it was first broken up and mixed into the rice to make it tastier.It is origin of \"Torimeshi\"In Aichi Prefecture, mixed rice such as “Torimeshi\" is called “Kakimawashi\" or “Kakimashi\" in some areas. The name “Kakimawashi\" or “Kakimashi\" is said to have come from the fact that the rice is cooked and the separately seasoned ingredients are stirred thoroughly.",

It is also made when people gather or when unusual ingredients become available. In some regions, there are community events such as neighborhood meetings that are based on 210 days passing after the 1st date of Japanese spring around early February. Usually this occurs around the beginning of September. On the 210th day after tasks like road maintenance or grass cutting on public roads, Kakimaze and sake are prepared for post-work relaxation. During these events, Kakimaze is not touched; instead, it is wrapped in leaves of Toimo (lotus root) and taken home. Children eagerly await this and enjoy this special occasion when they receive it.For celebratory occasions, tuna (shibi) or saury are used. Tuna is grated and pickled in vinegar, while saury is grilled, and the flesh is used after removing it from the bones. The ingredients are finely chopped and simmered together, seasoned with soy sauce and sugar. Sometimes, spring mountain vegetables are added. The rice is either cooled before mixing with seasoned vinegar or mixed with seasoned vinegar while still warm. The fish is then mixed in.In the town of Kanayama in Kumano City, a dish called \"Daikon-sushi\" is made primarily using locally abundant daikon radish. Additionally, there is a similarity in culinary culture with neighboring Wakayama Prefecture, where a local dish called \"Kakimaze-zushi\" is also found.Please note that these dishes may vary in preparation and ingredients across regions and households.",

    "history": "The Saijo persimmon, produced throughout the prefecture, is the representative persimmon of Shimane Prefecture. It is often harvested in Shimane Prefecture because of the combination of the sea breeze, temperature, and red soil of the Sea of Japan. Saijo persimmons originated in the Saijo district of Higashihiroshima City in Hiroshima Prefecture and are widely spread throughout the Chugoku and Shikoku regions. Because they are grown without the use of any herbicides, they must be carefully managed throughout the year, but this makes them fat and exceptionally sweet.The persimmon has a unique shape with four grooves and a smooth texture. The name \"kozuchi\" is derived from its resemblance to the \"uchide no kozuchi\" (small hammer) of Okuninushi no Mikoto, the deity of Izumo-taisha Shrine, which is why it is branded as such.Originally an astringent persimmon, after the astringency is removed, it becomes meltingly sweet with a sugar content of over 17 degrees. The flesh is so dense that the center becomes jelly-like. In the past, persimmons were soaked in shochu to remove the astringency, but now persimmons are placed in bags filled with dry ice to remove the astringency. Saijo persimmons are suitable for drying, and drying further concentrates the sugar content.Hamada City holds the top position in the production of Saijo persimmons. In the early Showa period, persimmon trees could be seen everywhere in the village. Fresh persimmons are shipped from early October to mid-November. After that, persimmon harvesting begins before the cold weather sets in, and the persimmons are dried and processed. In addition to dried persimmons, various other ways of eating persimmons have been handed down, including awashi persimmons soaked in hot water to remove the astringency, pickled persimmons made by pickling raw persimmons in salt, and, in an unusual twist, tempura persimmons. One of these is \"kakinamasu,\" dried persimmons made into a vinegared dish.",

In the middle of the Edo period (1603-1867), fishermen in Kishu (Wakayama Prefecture), who had to pay a high annual tribute, would take summer mackerel caught in the Kumano Sea, salt them, and sell them over a mountain pass to villages along the Yoshino River in order to raise money. There is a theory that it became a festival food during the summer festivals held in the villages around that time, or that it was changed from a preserved food or a soldier's food.Kakinoha sushi is made from astringent persimmon leaves, which are rich in tannin and have a bright green color. The vinegar in the rice and the persimmon leaves have an antiseptic effect, and by leaving the sushi overnight after it is made, the aroma of the persimmon leaves and the flavor of the mackerel are transferred to the vinegared rice, giving it a unique flavor and making it delicious.Instead of persimmon leaves, \"hakinoha-zushi\" is made with magnolia leaves that grow wild in the mountains, and is made from around the time of the Boys' Festival through the month of July. The recipe is the same as that for kakinoha sushi, but the aroma of the magnolia leaves is transferred to the vinegared rice.",

When pressed out of the wooden frame, six to eight pieces of the same size are formed at the same time, and the finished product is square, hence the name \"kaku-zushi\" (square sushi). It is sometimes called \"oshizushi\" or \"Inaka sushi\" (country sushi). The ingredients are sometimes changed according to the season or region, and are characterized by a decorative ingredient on top called \"Kami-oki\" and an ingredient in the sushi rice called \"Nakagu\". The \"Kami-oki\" is made up of brightly colored red, green, and yellow ingredients such as shime saba (mackerel), thinly fried egg, kamaboko (fish cake), shiitake mushrooms, aromatic mushrooms, matsutake mushrooms, chestnuts, sansho leaves, carrot leaves, dried shrimp, and denbu, while the \"Nakagu\" is made up of slightly salty carrot, shiitake mushroom, gobo, beans, etc., all of which are not visible from the outside. As you eat your way through the sushi rice, the rich flavor of the simmered ingredients suddenly spreads out. In addition, because the vegetables are seasoned and the seafood is heated, it tastes good even after a long time has passed. In the 1950s, it was common for each household to have a wooden form of kaku-zushi, and since kaku-zushi was traditionally served to guests on celebratory occasions and other special occasions, it was customary to make a larger quantity and distribute it in wooden boxes to neighbors and neighbors.",

The difference lies in the shape and size of the wooden box used. “Kakuzushi” is a type of sushi that can be easily made with “Mossou”, a small wooden box (about 5 cm square). In addition to the square shape, there are also flower shapes and pine, bamboo and plum shapes. On the other hand, the wooden box used in \"Hakozushi\" is larger than that of \"Kakuzushi\" and the finished product is cut into pieces before serving. In recent years, there are many areas where \"Kakuzushi\" is made easily in small amounts, but there are also areas where \"Hakozushi\", which can be made in large quantities at a time, has taken root as a local dish. “Hakozushi”, traditional in the Iwami region, is a type of pressed sushi that does not use fish or meat. Layer the sushi rice and vegetables in a square wooden box and place a thin plate between them. Then it is repeated and stacked: sushi rice, vegetables, thin plate...and so on. Finally, push from the top and apply pressure, cut into pieces, and garnish with thin strips of egg, sakura denpu (pink-colored minced fish) and green leaves (sansho (Japanese pepper) and carrot leaves). It is said that in the Edo period (1603 - 1868), the wife of the local governor dispatched to the area around the shogunate's domain of Iwami Ginzan (silver mine) missed the taste of Edo and handed down the cooking methods to the locals. Another theory is that it was introduced as food for soldiers during the Warring States period (1467-1603).",

Unlike regular \"Kamaboko\" fish paste, \"Kamabuku\" does not contain any fish paste. Instead, it is a mixture of potato purée, glutinous rice flour, sugar, and salt.

In the past, sushi boxes were mainly made of hard, odorless chinaberry wood, but in recent years, cedar and cypress are mostly used.

Sweet potatoes were dried to make them last longer. “Kankoro” is a traditional dessert made using these dried sweet potatoes. The name is said to come from the sound of the wooden rice paddle when mixing the potatoes and azuki beans in the pan. During the Meiji period, “mikan” (=Japanese mandarin) seeds were planted and grown in the Nishiuwa district, and this fruit became a specialty of the region. The sloping land of the district made it suitable for growing mikan. Terraced fields surrounded by stone walls prevented erosion and surface runoff, and improved soil drainage. Also, the stone walls reflected the sunlight onto the mikan trees which helped them grow even in the cold winters.

In this region, thin slices of sweet potato that are dried in the sun are referred to as “Kankoro”. A mixture of this kankoro and mochi is what makes “Kankoro Mochi”. In the past, this was a preservative food for the winter made by each household. The reason why kankoro was mixed with mochi was because glutinous rice used to make mochi was considered valuable at the time. The kankoro made the mochi more filling and was suitable for feeding large families. It has also been said that “Kirishitans” (=Catholic Christians), who came to the Goto Islands during the Edo period after being persecuted, made “Kankoro Mochi” to feed themselves.",

Drum cakes are a local dish that has been passed down in the Tsukui area of Sagamihara City since the Edo period.The Tsukui area is mountainous and not suited to growing rice; locals have long cultivated wheat and beans, and the flour-based food culture that took root centers on wheat. During the Edo period, people ate drum cakes for lunch or as a snack, wrapping uruka (the salt-cured intestines of an ayu sweetfish) or miso in dough and then steaming and frying it on the hot ash of a sunken hearth.Some say that kankoyaki, the Japanese name for drum cakes, comes from the fact that the cakes resemble in shape a type of taiko drum (kakko) used in traditional court music.",

For the cultivation of bottle gourd which becomes dried gourd strips, light soil with good drainage is desirable; this area where the \"Kanto Loam Formation\" is widely distributed is suitable for its cultivation. Also, the evening showers that are the mark of summer cool the ground surface and stimulate the growth of the bottle gourd’s roots, and their water content is the primary factor that leads to the development of the bottle gourd’s fruit. Thus blessed in topographical and meteorological conditions, dried gourd strip production became established here. The history of bottle gourd cultivation goes back over 300 years; it is said that the cultivation was brought about by \"Torii Tadateru\", the first \"daimyo of the Shimotsuke Mibu Domain\". It is said that in 1712, bottle gourd seeds were sent from \"Minaku Kizue\", Omi Province and successfully cultivated, and dried gourd strips began to be produced there.",

Kanpyo is a kind of dried food―thin strips of gourd pulp dried in the sun. Back then, the phrase 'norimaki' referred to 'kanpyo-maki,' and norimaki was generally wrapped in the shape of the Japanese letter 'no' regardless of being thin or thick, and it was one of the highlights of the professionals’ skill in rolling up the core ingredients so that they would not get loose.Also, roasted nori (roasted seaweed) is essential for kanpyo rolls. Nori is a type of seaweed that has been eaten with shellfish since ancient times in Japan, and during the Edo period, nori farming became popular in the area from present-day Shinagawa to Omori, where the sheet forming method by rinsing it like paper took root. At that time, Asakusa had a paper manufacturing industry that produced handmade recycled paper called “Asakusa-gami,” and the roasted seaweed of the Edo period came to be called “Asakusa-nori,” taking inspiration from that manufacturing method. Thanks to aquaculture, even ordinary people could obtain roasted nori, and in the Taisho period, people began to make norimaki at home. While everyone has eaten kanpyo-maki as a sushi dish in the Kanto region, it is still unfamiliar even today in the Kansai region as futo-maki is the mainstream there. Kanpyo-maki can be said to be a chic food unique to Edomae.",

Other flavorings such as ginger, kelp, and yuzu pepper are added to the seasoning liquid, and each household has its own special twist. When the radishes are dried, they are pierced with a bamboo skewer, threaded with string, and hung on a bamboo pole under the eaves. This sight is considered a part of the winter tradition in the Ashikita and Minamata areas.Nowadays, fewer people dry radishes at home, but dried radishes are sold so that you can season them to your taste at home.

It was initially made simply by mixing ground chili pepper with miso. Myoko City is located in the Joetsu region of Niigata Prefecture, adjacent to Nagano Prefecture. It snows a lot in this area, even being designated as an area with especially heavy snowfall. Therefore, it is said that Kanzuri was eaten to warm their bodies that were completely frozen in the extreme cold. Kanzuri is prepared in the coldest time of the year (around January 20th) through the process of Kanzarashi (meaning exposing to cold) which involves placing the salt-pickled chili pepper on the snow and drying it under the sun. It is also called Yukisarashi (meaning exposing to snow) as bright chili peppers are neatly arranged on top of pure white snow. Locally grown chili peppers are aged and fermented for three years after they are exposed to the snow, ground, and mixed with rice koji, yuzu, and salt. Chili peppers that have been exposed to the snow lose their bitterness and have more umami flavor. Kanzarashi is performed for three to four days on sunny days.",

He learned from a Japanese-Chinese book that lotus root has blood-enriching properties. He would never eat it. So, he stuffed a mixture of miso and Japanese mustard into the holes of the lotus root, coated it with a batter of flour, fava bean flour, and egg yolk, and deep-fried it in oil. The spiciness of the lotus root was so effective that people began to like it so much that they ate it regularly. The appearance of the sliced lotus root resembled the Hosokawa family's family crest, the Kuyo (Nine Yours) pattern, and Lord Tadatoshi kept the method of making \"mustard lotus root\" a secret, and the taste was kept out of the public until the Meiji Restoration.

    "history": "\"Karukan\" is a famous confectionery of Kagoshima Prefecture, made from \"karukan flour\", Japanese yams, and water, and is well known throughout the country. There are various theories about its origin, but the most popular is that it was invented by Rokubei Yashima, a confectioner from Akashi city, who was invited from Edo to study preserved foods by Nariakira Shimazu, the 11th lord of the Satsuma Domain.Despite the geographical conditions that most of the land, except for Mt. Kirishima, is on the Shirasu Plateau, which is very well drained and is frequently hit by typhoons, which can easily damage the crops that have been grown there, It is believed that \"Karukan\" took root because Japanese yam, the ingredient of \"Karukan,\" grew wild on the Shirasu Plateau, and sugar was easily obtained from the Amami area and the Ryukyu Islands. But at that time, however, sugar was extremely precious, so it was not eaten by the general public, but was a \"lord's confectionery\" eaten mainly by feudal lords' families. It is said that it was not until the Meiji period (1868-1912) that karukan spread to the general public. \"Karukan\" is written \"軽羹\" in Chinese characters, which means \"light kan (yokan). The reason for this is that when the dough is steamed, it becomes lighter than it was before steaming. In recent years, \"karukan manju,\" a sweet bean paste wrapped in \"karukan\" dough, has become common, and is a popular souvenir for tourists from outside the prefecture.",

It grows wild throughout the Amami region, and in addition to \"Kasha Mochi,\" it is also used to wrap rice balls. It is a confectionary made from mugwort, brown sugar, and \"kumatake orchid\" leaves, all of which are ingredients with high efficacy that can be found close at hand.In the Amami region, the rice cake sticks to the \"kumatake orchid\" leaves, and the synergistic effect of the ingredients enhances the flavor, which is why it is sometimes likened to a good partner being \"like a rice cake and a kasha\".",

Kashiwa Mochi, which is eaten throughout Japan, is a celebratory rice cake made of fine white rice flour and white bean flour, and filled with red bean paste or miso bean paste. The leaves of sarutori ibara, a deciduous tree of the beech family, which wrap the rice cake, have been used since the Edo period (1603-1867) to bring good luck that \"the family lineage will never cease\" because the leaves do not fall until new shoots appear in early summer.In Yamaguchi Prefecture, it is one of the most popular local dishes, and has many aliases such as \"hoten-do-mochi,\" \"iginoha-mochi,\" \"puton-mochi,\" and \"botan-mochi. In the past, it was made and eaten at home during Tango no Sekku, rice planting, and Obon festivals. It is said that the rice planting, which was done by hand, was especially hard work, and the eating of \"Kashiwa Mochi\" was one of the pleasures. It is also said that once the Kashiwa Mochi were made, they were distributed to next door neighbors.

Sake lees have also been used since the Heian period as a way to preserve fish and vegetables. Sake lees are rich in yeast, protein, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nourishing food. The custom of eating kasu-jiru on January 20, the last day of the New Year celebration, involves making broth from the heads and bones of salmon and amberjack, which were eaten during the New Year, and simmering them with sake lees and vegetables to celebrate the end of the season.",

In this region, “okara” is referred to as “kasu”. Another theory is that since different types of vegetables are used together in this recipe, the name came from the word “kazuyose” (=bring numbers together). Another name for this dish is “Oshiyose”, meaning bringing together available ingredients. Different types of rice may be used for the dish and some families opt to use glutinous rice or rice dumplings instead of white rice.The recipe differs per region and some recipes always include pumpkin while others do not. The ingredients are lightly seasoned with soy sauce, mirin (=sweet rice wine) and sugar (soft brown sugar) to enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients.",

It is said that in the old days, when cooking methods had not yet been established, \"kasube\", which emitted an ammonia odor inside the body, had a strong smell and was shunned.So,It is said that the name was derived from the fact that the fish is \"nothing but dregs,\" which cannot be eaten either boiled or baked. Another theory is that the name comes from the Ainu word “kashumbe/kashupe”.The Ainu people traditionally consumed dried \"kasube\" and other fish, which they would pound and eat with boiled wild plants. However, the fish's strong odor meant that it was not highly valued for its taste, and was instead used as fertilizer. In recent times, new methods have been developed to extract the odor and prepare the fish in a more enjoyable way, making it a popular food choice.The “megane kasube\" is the most commonly eaten species in Hokkaido. It is identified by a large eyeball-like pattern on its back and is mostly found in the Soya and Rumoi regions on the northern side of the Sea of Japan. It is also known as \"makasube\" in this area.

The practice of using daikon in the winter and soft nira in the early spring to improve the flavor while increasing the volume is said to have been started by common people when food was scarce. About 40 years ago, when nira cultivation began to flourish in Kanuma City, \"Nira Soba\" (garlic chive buckwheat noodles) became commercialized at a soba shop and since then has been offered at many shops throughout the city. \"Nira Soba\" was established around Kanuma City, and \"Daikon Soba\" was established around Sano City. According to the results of a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tochigi prefecture is the third largest producer of soba in Japan, and it is an essential cuisine for both daily life and special events. Kanuma City and the surrounding area used to produce hemp as well. \"Asa-Ato Soba\" (after-hemp soba) made from the buckwheat planted to restore nutrients to the soil after the hemp harvest. The hemp production is smaller today, but buckwheat continues to be cultivated, and a large amount of nira are produced, resulting in \"Kanuma Nira Soba.\"",

    "name": "Katemeshi",
    "prefecture": "Saitama Prefecture",
    "history": "“Katemeshi” is a well-established local dish in Saitama Prefecture, and especially the Chichibu region. This dish seems to have been created by adding various ingredients to rice in order to increase the amount that could be eaten, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of rice production. It was difficult for rice to be a diet mainstay in areas unsuitable for rice cultivation. In fact, even in areas that were suitable for rice cultivation, rice remained a valuable cash crop for small farmers, who used it to pay rent to their landowners. Because of this, once the harvested rice had been divided up for weddings and funerals, the remainder was often sold by the farmers. As a result, to increase the bulk of the leftover rice scraps that could be eaten, a dish was created in which seasoned and boiled vegetables such as potatoes and daikon radish were added. The Katemeshi which is served at school lunches in the northern part of Saitama Prefecture is made of vinegared rice mixed with regional ingredients. By contrast, in the southern part of the Prefecture, which includes Saitama City, Katemeshi is made by mixing either white or light brown rice with “zuiki” (dried taro stems). In the Chichibu region, adding “zuiki” to rice is also standard practice. Thus, one of Katemeshi’s characteristics is that the flavor of the rice and the ingredients that are added to it vary depending on the region and the family serving it. Although it is popular today as a home-cooked meal, the fact that Katemeshi is made with soy sauce, which was known among farmers as a seasoning for “hare no hi” (special occasions), indicates that it was actually a dish mostly eaten for special occasions. In fact, it is said to have been cooked more often than “Gomoku Chirashi”, another rice dish eaten on “hare no hi”. Especially in urban areas, it was eaten for “hare no hi” in the same way as sushi.",

Freshly harvested wheat was ground into flour to make yakimochi (baked rice cakes), or filled with sweet bean paste made from soramame, which were then laid out on a boroku and baked slowly. In the past, myoga leaves were planted in the gardens of many homes and were easily available at this time of year. This combination skillfully makes use of the bounty of nature available at that time of the year.",

As for the origin, it is said to be in Kenchoji, a temple of Zen Buddhism in Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture. It is said that the Kazuhisa of Kenchoji Temple ate vegetable scraps and skins as soup to avoid wasting them, and this eventually became known as \"Kenchojiru\" and came to be called by local names such as \"Kenchan\" and \"Kenchinjiru\".In Kunisaki City, there is a recipe for eating udon noodles together with root vegetables.

Okara is soy pulp which is a by-product of tofu and the people of Kochi made good use of it in this way. “Kibinago no Hokaburi” is a type of tamazushi using the fish “kibinago” (=silver-stripe round herring), which is a small fish measuring to around 10cm in length. The small kibinago is carefully opened by hand and soaked in vinegar and then wrapped around the okara. The cute roundness of the sushi is said to look like the shape of a person’s head which is how it got the name “Hokaburi”, meaning a person wearing a washcloth on their head.Sukumo city actively promotes “Kibinago no Hokaburi” as one of their specialties. Kibinago are caught in large amounts in Sukumo Bay and in 1985, the area caught over 3,000 tons of kibinago. The number of fish caught has since decreased but in in the early 1990s, more than 2,000 tons of kibinago were still being caught. Kibinago is still popular today and it is served at local restaurants as sashimi, tempura and “nanbanzuke” (=marinade of sweet and peppery vegetable sauce). In Shimanto city and surrounding areas, sardines are used instead of kibinago, and the dish is called “rokuyata”.",

Kyoto Prefecture has designated vegetables that have been cultivated in the prefecture since ancient times as \"Kyoto's traditional vegetables\" and is attempting to brand them. In branding, the vegetables are defined as those introduced before the Meiji era, and are grown in all areas of Kyoto Prefecture, excluding mushrooms and ferns.While chili peppers are generally thought of as spicy, the Fushimi Togarashi is also known as \"Fushimi amanaga\" because it is not spicy and has a unique sweet taste. When ripe, the fruit turns red like a red pepper, but the pungency does not increase. The blue and red fruits are sometimes combined to add color to dishes.Compared to the \"Manganji Togarashi,\" which is also grown in Kyoto, it is slender and 10 to 15 cm long. In the market, it is known by the nickname \"Aoto.The young leaves are called \"Kigosho\" and together with the small fruits are used for food such as tsukudani.

For example, the carp streamers (\"Koinobori\") are decorated to symbolize the desire for success, based on the legend that carp that swim upstream and overcome the waterfall called \"Ryumon\" transform into dragons. The samurai helmet and armor also have significance, representing the protection of the body. Shobu (iris) is another essential item during Children's Day, believed to ward off evil, and it is incorporated into dishes like Chimaki and Shobuyu (iris-flavored hot water). Similarly, \"Kii-nai Okowa\" is associated with the belief that the color yellow wards off evil, and the accompanying black beans carry prayers for good health.In the past, red rice served at celebratory occasions was considered a luxurious dish. To make a more accessible alternative, people began using kuromame (black soybeans) and kuchinashi (gardenia) seeds to color rice yellow, marking the beginning of \"Kii-nai Okowa.\"",

In the Chugoku region, there is an event called \"Hayashida\" or \"Tabayashi,\" in which a large number of people plant rice while playing drums and flutes and singing rice-planting songs. These events, which have been handed down from the Middle Ages, were a ritual for rice cultivation to worship the \"god of rice fields\" to pray for peace and a good harvest, and at the same time, they were a major event that served as a consolation for those engaged in the hard work of rice planting and as one of the few entertainment elements in the farming villages of the time. The \"Hayashida\" of Mibu, Kita Hiroshima Town, in particular, came to be called \"Mibu no Hana Taue\" (flower rice planting in Mibu) because of its extravagant pageantry, with the participating oxen wearing gorgeous flower garlands and dressed-up Saotome girls planting seedlings to the sound of drums and flutes.

Washimiya Kokoku-ji in Wakayama Prefecture.Later, during the Edo period, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth shogun, is said to have gifted Kinzanji Miso to the shogunate, which led to its popularity in Edo (present-day Tokyo).There is also a theory that Kinzanji Miso played a role in the origin of soy sauce.",

    "history": "Usuki City is located in southeastern Oita Prefecture, and stretches out in an oval shape towards Hoyo Strait. It is on Usuki Bay facing Bungo Channel to the east, and the ridges of Mount Chinnan and Mount Himedake to the southwest. Fishing has long been practiced in the coastal communities, where single-hook handline fishing, longline fishing, and small trawl fishing are used. Specialty products include hairtail, yellowtail and blowfish. “Kirasumameshi” is a local cuisine of Usuki City, along with “Ohan” and “Chadaizushi”. Unlike the familiar winter dish of \"Ohan\" and the hospitality dish of \"Chadaizushi\", \"Kirasumameshi\" is eaten all year round. During the middle of the Edo period (about 1700 - 1750), the Usuki domain, which was often in financial difficulties, issued a decree of thrift and often regulated what to eat and wear. It was during this time that \"Kirasumameshi\" was born. Leftover sashimi or fish that have been cut were coated with okara, which is the dregs of soybeans, and used to increase the volume. It was a thrifty dish, yet rich in nutrition and loved by the common people. In the Usuki region's dialect, okara is called \"kirazu\", and “mabusu” (dredge) is called \"mamesu”. Therefore, the dish is named \"Kirasumamesi\", which means sashimi dredged (“mamesu”) with “kirazu”. During the era of the domain, merchants and people delivering \"Nengu (annual tributes)\" from the mountains were said to look forward to eating “Kirasumameshi” with great expectation.",

Also, dishes using \"kirizushi\" were served at wedding celebrations as a good luck charm, with the hope of \"never breaking the marriage bond\".Kirazu mochi is a local sweet made from this bean curd. Kirazu mochi is a rice cake made of glutinous rice and kirazu mixed with sweet red bean paste, and is only found in the Ogawa area in the western part of Sagawa.In the old days, it was customary to make tofu before New Year's, and each family would ask a contracted soybean grinder to grind a square of soybeans for them. Making tofu produces okara (bean curd). This bean curd was made into \"kirazu-mochi\" and eaten at New Year's, just like tofu.In Kochi Prefecture, sweetened and roasted okara has been a common side dish for a long time, including \"tai no tama-mushi\" (sea bream steamed in soy sauce), which is made by stuffing seasoned okara into the back of open sea bream and steaming it; \"tama-zushi\" (sushi ball with sardines in vinegar), which is made by rolling okara into round balls and placing them on top; and \"kibinago no hokaburi\" (yellowtail roe wrapped with kibinago), which is made by rolling okara with kibinago. and \"Kibinago no Hookaburi,\" which is made by wrapping okara with kibinago (dried yellowtail).",

Natto, a good source of protein, was very valuable at a time when meat and fish were scarce, and it is said that natto was first eaten by people who chopped surplus pickles and vegetables into small pieces and increased the quantity. This dish was born from the wisdom of grandmothers, who used vegetables that were close at hand and used even the scraps carefully. It was also an important nutrient for our ancestors who lived in a harsh natural environment, as it is easy to prepare and provides efficient nutritional intake.

It is the soul food of Aichi Prefecture, eaten everywhere, and has its roots in the flat udon (called \"Himokawa\") that were a specialty of present-day Kariya City. There are many theories about the origin of the name \"Kishimen\", but it is said to have derived from the Chinese confectionery \"Kishimen\". Chinese \"Kishimen\" are made by kneading wheat flour, rolling it out flat, plucking it out with a bamboo tube, etc., in the shape of a go stone, boiling it, and then sprinkling soybean flour over it. It is said that the reason why \"Kishimen\" has become popular in Aichi Prefecture is that the taste of the dipping sauce is easier to soak up than udon, which suits the people who like strong flavors. In the traditional way, the dipping sauce is seasoned with mackerel scad and tamari (thick soy sauce). This is because the flat noodles have a light taste in the mouth, and the soup needs to be well seasoned. Mackerel scad can be used to extract a thicker soup stock with a more peculiar flavor than bonito. While soy sauce is made of soybeans and wheat, tamari is made almost entirely of soybeans and has a faint, distinctive aroma of miso. By combining this with the soup stock, a thick dipping sauce is prepared.",

This flavorful broth is complemented with sweet and savory simmered aburaage (deep-fried tofu pockets). Osaka udon is known for its broth that blends well with the noodles, providing a chewy yet not overly thick texture.Among the various udon dishes, Kitsune Udon holds a special place in the hearts of Osaka locals and can be considered one of the most beloved udon dishes in the prefecture.The history of noodle consumption, including udon and soba, traces back to being special meals in temples and shrines. Over time, these noodles became a staple in the daily diet of people across Japan. In Osaka, the history of udon consumption is extensive. During the construction of Osaka Castle by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, there were reports of udon and soba shops lining an area known as \"Sunaba\" (a material storage location) near present-day Shinmachi in Osaka. The widespread popularity of udon in Osaka began around the mid-Edo period. As commerce thrived in the bustling city known as the \"Kitchen of the Nation,\" ingredients such as kombu from Hokkaido, wheat flour, and salt gathered along with various foodstuffs. These carefully selected ingredients were used to make udon.In the early Meiji era, numerous noodle factories emerged in Osaka, and due to the busy nature of these establishments, many eateries began sourcing noodles from these factories. Simultaneously, both restaurants and households put considerable effort into refining the taste of their broths and dipping sauces.It is said that Kitsune Udon had its origins in 1893 (Meiji 26) at the udon shop \"Matsubaya\" (now Usamitei Matsubaya) in the Osaka district of Funamachi. A customer placed a piece of aburaage served as a side dish on plain udon and enjoyed the combination. This marked the beginning of Kitsune Udon in Osaka.Osaka residents take great pride in their rich broth culture and their deep affection for konamon (flour-based food) culture. Kitsune Udon perfectly embodies these two elements, offering a simple yet deeply satisfying culinary experience for the people of Osaka.",

Hiroshima Bay is rich in plankton, which serves as bait for small sardines, so well grown sardines are caught in abundance. As a result, approximately 70% of the catch landed in Hiroshima Prefecture is anchovy (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \"2020 Fishery and Aquaculture Production Statistics\").They are caught with sardine boat seines, which are sometimes referred to locally as \"patch net fishing\" because the shape of the net resembles the patches on a man's underwear. In the old days, peddlers were often seen selling fresh small sardines, which were cheap, tasty, and a valuable foodstuff for the common people. Washing small sardines in water removes the scales and removes the unique smell of small sardines. Sashimi is served with soy sauce and grated ginger. Its firm flesh is said to be as tasty as sea bream, the king of fish, and there is even a food proverb that says, \"If you wash sardines seven times, they taste like sea bream\". The season is from June to August. Because of its high unsaturated fatty acid content, freshness is essential for sashimi, but because Hiroshima is close to fishing grounds, fresh small sardines can be found in supermarkets and fresh fish stores. In Hiroshima, many people use a spoon or packing tape (PP band) to quickly cut the small sardines. In addition to raw fish, boiled and dried \"iriko (=dried sardines)\" are used as soup stock mainly in western Japan, and \"chirimen\" made from young sardines (=shirasu) is also widely eaten.",

It is said that one of the reasons for this is that during the Meiji period, many of the citizens of Toyama Prefecture who moved to Hokkaido for development purposes lived in the Rausu region, and there they sent Rausu kelp, a specialty of the town, to their relatives in Toyama. The standard fish used for kobujime is swordfish, which Toyama residents call “sasu,” but other white fish such as sea bream and flounder, as well as Toyama's specialties, white shrimp and firefly squid, are also used.

In the Kamakura period (1185-1333), trading ships began to carry kelp between the Matsumae area and Honshu, and in the Muromachi period (1333-1573), kelp was carried to Tsuruga in Echizen Province (present Fukui Prefecture) and then to Kyoto and Osaka. Later, as kelp fishing flourished during the Edo period (1603-1867), consumption of kelp increased, and it became a major transport item on the \"Kitamae-bune,\" a Kansai route around the Sea of Japan.

This led to the creation of Japanese cuisine using kelp in many regions. Tsuruga, located in Fukui Prefecture, was one of the ports of call for the Kitamae-bune. With its prosperity, food culture from different regions was brought in. Kelp and herring were two of the most prominent foods brought from the north.

In the agricultural setting, soybeans were cultivated in the ridges of paddy fields, and wheat was grown in the back fields for self-consumption. Currently, wheat production is increasing in Shiga Prefecture, and many recipes use wheat flour. Sometimes rice flour is used, giving the snack a chewy and delicious texture.Shiga Prefecture has a history of agricultural development centered around rice cultivation, earning it the nickname \"Rice Granary of Kinki\" due to the abundance and quality of rice produced. Consequently, dishes made with rice, such as snacks like mochi and dango, have been popular. \"Kofukumame\" is one such snack. In times when sweet treats were scarce, \"Kofukumame,\" made by mixing roasted soybeans and rice flour with sugar and water, then baking the mixture, were enjoyed as snacks during breaks from agricultural work. Other snacks from that era included mashed sweet potatoes, sweetened rice dumplings, green pea dumplings, and soup dumplings, all of which were hearty and satisfying treats.",

The freshly fried lake fish has no unpleasant odor and is delicious. Shrimp with its shell, known as suji ebi, is also used for tempura and mixed tempura.The ideal fish for \"Tempura of Lake Fish\" is the small sweetfish from Lake Biwa. These sweetfish, which grow to only about 7 cm in length, concentrate a delicious flavor and have a soft texture, making them easy to eat. Fishing for them takes place from around May to early August.Apart from small sweetfish, Isaza is also commonly consumed as tempura. Isaza, a type of goby, inhabits the deep waters around 70 meters in Lake Biwa, leading to fishing activities in the deep northern region of the lake. Isaza is distinctive for its unique flavor.Initially not native to Lake Biwa, smelt (Wakasagi) has become suitable for tempura following Isaza. While the exact reason for the appearance of smelt in Lake Biwa is not clear, their population has increased with higher catches, following the trend set by small sweetfish. Wakasagi inhabit almost the entire area of Lake Biwa, mainly in the northern region, and are also found in Lake Yogo. They come into season from late November to the end of January.",

Later, carp became widespread among the populace, and a variety of carp dishes became popular. It is said that carp become dragons when they climb up the Ryumon Falls, and they are a symbol of good fortune used as a metaphor for success in life. It was customary to serve carp on ceremonial occasions such as betrothal banquets, as well as to pregnant women, due to its rich nutrients.Carp are raised in Kasumigaura over a period of one to three years. Year-old carp are commonly used in a sashimi dish called \"koi no arai\" because their smaller bones do not easily hurt the mouth. Two- to three-year-old female carp have eggs, making them suitable for dishes such as \"koi no kanroni\" (carp stewed in sweetened soy sauce). The availability of carp of various sizes is thought to be the reason why other carp dishes such as \"koikoku\" (carp stewed in miso soup) and \"koi no umani\" (carp stewed in sugar, soy sauce, and sake) have gained popularity. Today, fried carp is one of the most popular carp dishes for both children and adults.",

It is said that the practice began in 1802, when Yozan Uesugi, the ninth lord of the Yonezawa domain, proposed the promotion of koi (=Carp) farming in order to secure nourishing foodstuffs in Yonezawa, an inland area with scarce fishery resources. Yozan had a pond built near the drainage outlet of houses (the pond is called “Sesena”), where he had people raised koi (=Carp) using rice water (water left over from washing rice), leftovers, and silkworm chrysalis (called “Mayu-mi”) as food.Koi (=Carp) was a luxury food, so the common people usually ate koi (=Carp) dishes only on special occasions. Koi (=Carp) farming flourished mainly in the Okitama region and developed from the Taisho to Showa periods. Koi (=Carp) farming methods in this region included rearing them in clean spring water or groundwater to make them spit out mud.Koi (=Carp) farmed in and around Yonezawa City are said to be of high quality and firm due to the severe winter cold, and under the brand name of \"Yonezawa koi (=Carp),\" they are a local specialty along with Yonezawa beef and Tateyama apples.

In 1825, when Iwamurada feudal lord Naito Toyogomori returned from Osaka, he gave Yodo carp to Namiki Nanazaemon, a wealthy merchant in Nozawa, and the cultivation of Saku carp took root. After 1872, with the development of mechanical spinning, it became easier to obtain \"Sanagi,\" or carp, which could be used as feed for mass production, and carp farming rapidly developed, and the name \"Saku Koi\" became nationally known. As time went by, changes in eating habits and the spread of agricultural chemicals caused the gradual decline of carp farming in Saku City, but recent years have seen the spread of reduced pesticide cultivation and adjustments to reduce the amount of pesticides used, and efforts to revive the \"Saku carp\" have begun.Usually, carp are shipped after two years, but \"Saku carp\" takes three to four years to grow to a suitable size for eating. Koikoku,\" a traditional soup in Saku City, is made by boldly cutting the fish into cylindrical slices and simmering them in miso paste, and is an indispensable New Year's dish in the Saku area. The \"koikoku\" was first eaten on New Year's Day when Shinozawa Sagoemon Shigeno Baido, an ancestor of Saku Hotel President Shinozawa for eight generations before him, invited Fukushima Toba Taio, a priest of Ise Jingu Shrine, to his residence on the sixth day of the New Year in 1746, and fed him \"koikoku\". Koi no umani\" (carp cooked in a sweet broth) is a familiar dish in the Saku area, and if the carp has a good fat content, it melts in the mouth. The flesh of carp is light, fluffy, and fatty, and good soup stock is made from the ara. Although people tend to think of carp as being muddy, \"Saku carp\" raised in a clear stream is delicious as sashimi, and \"arai,\" a type of carp that has been firmed up in cold water, goes well with Saku's locally brewed sake.",

The fish used are the fish in season, such as yellowtail mackerel, Pacific saury, and horse mackerel. The development of oshizushi is thought to be due to the development of sushi molds using the rich wood (mainly hinoki) of Higashi-Kishu. Oshi-zushi molds come in a variety of sizes, such as one, five, and three cups of rice. Recently, in addition to the traditional kata, many other kata have been made, including small, easy-to-handle kata for a small number of people, kata for one person, kata for one layer, and so on. In the Sugari district of Owase City, a large oshi-gata for two and a half cups is also used. Leaves of wild strawberry and myoga leaves are used as dividers between the two molds, allowing the leaves' smell and ingredients to permeate the sushi, enhancing its flavor and aroma. They are also said to have antiseptic properties. If these leaves are not available in urban areas, substitute mustard greens or lettuce. A bento box can be used as a substitute for the sushi mold. The lid is turned upside down and the food is placed in the box, and the body of the box is pressed down from the top in place of the lid.",

The locals prepared ‘Himeji’ in advance when the summer festivals were approaching because ‘Himeji’ had to be fillet and left for a while after salt was sprinkled over it.

The area has been influenced by the history of brown sugar, which was a very high quality foodstuff. During the period when the island belonged to the Satsuma clan, annual tribute was paid in brown sugar, which was very expensive at the time, instead of rice, and the Satsuma clan had a monopoly on brown sugar. The Satsuma clan monopolized the production of brown sugar, and the islanders were forced to give priority to the production of brown sugar, creating a harsh situation called \"brown sugar hell\" in which they were unable to produce enough food for their daily needs. In addition, after the war, large sugar factories were built in order to focus on domestic sugar production, and the traditional culture of brown sugar production in the Amami region was in danger of dying out. Thus, the production of brown sugar in the Amami region has been tossed about with the times, but it has taken strong root as a sweetener that supports the food culture of the Amami Islands and the Kagoshima mainland from the bottom up.Because brown sugar contains a lot of nectar, it tends to clump together, and most of the brown sugar sold in general is in the form of crushed blocks. Because of its deep, caramel-like flavor, brown sugar is not as versatile as white sugar, but it is widely used in dishes that take advantage of its flavor.",

It is easy to eat even in the summer when appetites tend to decrease, so it is frequently made at home. It is said that the name \"Koneri\" comes from the fact that it is thickened (\"neru\") with flour. In the Kunisaki Peninsula, \"Koneri\" made from eggplant and bitter melon is referred to as \"Holland,\" but the reason is unknown. It is also called \"Kokake,\" \"Ankake,\" and \"Babakoroshi.\"In Bungo Ono City, with its undulating topography and rivers of various sizes, boasts one of the best dry-field farming areas in the prefecture, with an abundant eggplant cultivation. The eggplants produced in this region have a beautiful appearance, and they are trademarked under the name \"Bi-nasu\" (beautiful eggplant).

The region faces three seas - the Yatsushiro Sea, the Amakusa Sea, and the Ariake Sea. This dish has been passed down since the Edo period and is considered a symbol of good luck.\"Konoshiro fish\" is a member of the herring family that lives in brackish water. Small fish that are as young as 5 cm in length are referred to as \"shinko\" and are a delicacy at sushi restaurants, commanding high prices. Interestingly, the smaller the fish, the higher the price. The Chinese character for \"winter\" is used to represent this fish, which is caught during the fall and winter seasons when it is at its fattiest. However, in the Yatsushiro Sea, where the Kuma River meets the sea, this fish can be caught all year round. Its limited shelf life and quick loss of freshness make it difficult to find far from the city. This fish is best served with vinegar, which enhances its flavor and shelf life. \"Konoshiro sugata sushi\" is made by cutting open the fish either from the back or the belly. The entrails and inside bones are removed, and the fish is then salted and dipped in sweet vinegar. After that, it is filled with rice sticks and shaped into sushi. Finally, the head and tail are placed upright on a plate. The moderate saltiness and sweetness of the vinegar, along with the spices such as green onion, ginger, and sesame seeds in the sushi rice, make it delicious even without soy sauce. Along the Yatsushiro Sea coast, there is a type of sushi called \"konoshiro-zushi\", also known as yoshino sushi or unohana-zushi, which is made from okara (soy pulp) that is produced during the process of making tofu. To prepare \"konoshiro-zushi\", the okara is sautéed with chopped carrots and green onions and then seasoned with vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar. There are two types of \"konoshiro-zushi\": the first type, called \"katazushi,\" is stuffed into the belly, and the second type is wrapped around the okara, which is then cut into three pieces, seasoned with vinegar, and rolled in konoshiro.",

Later, as they followed the girl who had left, she disappeared at Zenjoji Temple and then reappeared as the goddess Kannon.

Another explanation for the name is that it comes from the rare method of drying without hanging them, known nationwide as \"Korokaki.\"While it's common to string and hang dried persimmon using ropes, Korokaki Persimmon is dried on multiple-layered shelves in a drying area called \"Kakiya.\" After drying, they are taken down from the Kakiya and further dried by rolling them on a sieve. This unique process led to the name \"Korokaki\" (rolling) Persimmon.Korokaki Persimmon is considered the origin of tea sweets, and their natural sweetness has become a standard for the sweetness of Japanese confections.

There’s even a record stating it was a special product of the prefecture in the late Edo period. “Koshu ko-umezuke,” which was created through trial and error to find the right texture and salt content, is also known as “karikari-zuke” because of its crunchy (karikari) texture, and is overwhelmingly popular among the processed plum products in the prefecture.

    "history": "“Sauce-marinated” is a local dish in the Minami-Boso region of Chiba prefecture, in which whale meat is marinated in a sauce and dried. It has the appearance of tree bark, and is colored black like charcoal or seaweed. A type of whale known as the giant beaked whale, which grows to roughly 12 meters long, is used to make “sauce-marinated.” The excavation of many whale bones from archaeological sites in Kamakura City, together with other evidence, suggest that coastal whaling may have begun in Boso between the late Kamakura Period (13th century) and the Muromachi Period (14th to 15th century). Even though “net whaling” became the mainstream whaling method in many areas, whaling in the Minami-Boso area is unique as net whaling was not suitable for giant beaked whales because they dive deep, leading to the adoption of “pierce whaling”.Whaling was common throughout Japan until the Showa period, and was a source of food for the general populace. “Sauce-marinated” is said to have been prepared as a preserved food due to the abundance of whale meat in the days where refrigerators did not yet exist. The Japanese name for \"sauce-marinated whale meat (kujira-no-tare)\" is said to have come from the fact that \"whale (kujira) meat\" was marinated in sauce (tare) and dried, or the fact that whale meat was hung from the eaves of houses. It is an indispensable and familiar part of the diet of the citizens of the Minami-Boso region, and people who have moved to other prefectures often buy sauce-marinated whale meat whenever they return to their hometowns in the region.",

In some parts of the region, it is also referred to as \"Kujina-jiru.\"From the late Edo period to the Meiji period when herring fishing was a popular activity, the whales that would \"herd the herring to the shore\" were regarded as a good omen in Southern Hokkaido. Thus, it is said to have been eaten on New Year's to pray for a bountiful herring catch from early spring.Whales are a valuable source of protein in Hokkaido, and they are salted and made into preserved food as a way to survive in the harsh winters.The salted whales are used as an ingredient in \"Kujira-jiru.\" The other ingredients simmered in the soup consist of wintering vegetables that are harvested in the late autumn season and preserved food such as salt-pickled mountain vegetables.

There are various theories about its origin, but one theory is that a tofu maker in Arita who visited Nagasaki at the beginning of the Showa period to buy soybeans learned from a Chinese person how to make tofu using \"kudzu\".

It's a straightforward sweet that allows you to fully enjoy the flavor of the chestnut itself. Originally, people used to eat chestnuts by boiling or roasting wild chestnuts, but over time, the method of squeezing boiled chestnuts with a cloth to create a form similar to Kuri Kinton emerged, marking the beginning of this confection.Considered the birthplace of Kuri Kinton and one of the leading chestnut-producing areas in the prefecture, Nakatsugawa City flourished during the Edo period as one of the important post towns along the Nakasendo highway, a major route connecting Edo (present-day Tokyo) with Kyoto and Osaka.

At these festivals, newly harvested rice is offered to the gods and people show appreciation for the bountiful harvest.The \"Imari Kunchi\" held in Imari-cho, Imari City in October is a fighting festival in which portable shrines and Danjiris fight each other, and is called \"Imari Ton-ten-ton\" from the sound of the taiko drums. Traditional families of the region prepare for this festival a few days ahead and make “kikka kabu” (=pickled chrysanthemum turnip), “kogui” (=crucian carp prepared with seasonal vegetables), “nishime” (=simmered vegetables) and “amazake” (=sweet, fermented rice drink). “Kuri Okowa” was made and given to the participants of “Kunchi” as a gift to take home with them. In other regions as well, \"Kuri Okowa\" is an indispensable dish for autumn festivals. At the autumn festivals of Niu Shrine in the Shiota and Ookusano districts and Hachimangu Shrine in the Kuma district, they make a lot of \"Kuri Okowa\" to entertain their guests. In Arita, during “Kunchi” in October, the “Kuri Okowa” is served in the shape of a folding-fan, which is considered good luck. This dish is often made with dried chestnuts as the name for this in Japanese is “Kachi Guri”, and the word “kachi” means to win in Japanese, and so this ingredient was used to incorporate the wish of winning the festival.

Although the scene of work in the rice paddies used to be a wintertime tradition, the number of Kuroda Seri farmers in the town has dwindled to a few.Kuroda Seri is characterized by its peculiar aroma, but Kuroda Seri is less acrid and more fragrant, and in the 1930s it was labeled \"the best in Japan\" by Kitaoji Rosanjin.

In the tenth century, it was distinguished from the soybean as a \"black bean\" in books, and in the sixteenth century, the name \"black bean\" was used as an offering to the court, suggesting that cultivation was already flourishing by this time. Because the land is fertile and they are cultivated in an inland climate with a large temperature difference between day and night, the grains grow large and have a rich taste. Because of the long cultivation period of six months and the technical difficulties, the beans were sometimes called \"Kurou mame (hardship beans)\" by some growers. Large, wrinkle-free, shiny, black soybeans have a great taste when cooked. Recipes such as edamame and bean rice with unripe beans are common, as they allow you to enjoy the flavors of the ingredients directly.

It is characterized by its donut-like shape and is said to have gotten its name from the fact that it resembles a wheel when sliced into rings. Three-layer rolls are common, and four-layer rolls are rare because they require more time and effort. To stabilize the quality of the fu, it is left to rest for one to two days, then cut into short pieces, steamed to soften them, and then cut into rings and dried. It takes at least three days to dry and up to five days during periods of high humidity such as the rainy season. Because it takes nearly a week to complete this process, only a few companies in Niigata Prefecture currently make four-layer kurumafu.",

Nishio City and Gamagori City have the highest catches, while the Atsumi Peninsula and Chita Peninsula also contribute to the clam industry. The supply of clams is supported by resource management, such as the creation of tidal flats and shallow areas in Mikawa Bay and the transplantation of young clams from the Rokujo Lagoon at the mouth of the Toyokawa River. In addition, the nets used in the Mikawa Bay clam fishery are designed to prevent overfishing by making the nets (mangas) large enough to allow small clams to pass through. The shallow waters and gentle waves of Mikawa Bay create an environment that is ideal for the growth of clams. As a result, many dishes using clams are prepared in the coastal areas of Mikawa Bay. “Kushi-asari” is a simple local dish made by skewering clams and drying them in the sun. “Kushi-asari” was offered to the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Edo period and was also served at inns along the Tokaido Highway, where it was enjoyed by a wide range of people. In Kamezaki, Handa City, where the Kamezaki-shiohimatsuri Festival is held, “kushi-asari” has become an integral part of the festival.

    "prefecture": "Hiroshima Prefecture",
    "history": "Kuwai no Ama-ni is a stew that is known for its sweet taste, which is seasoned with broth, sugar, and mirin. The dish is named after \"kuwaimo,\" a potato-like fruit that grows under the leaves shaped like a hoe for digging up the earth. There are three types of arrowhead: ao kuwai (blue arrowhead), shiroi kuwai (white arrowhead), and suita kuwai. Ao kuwai, the main type grown in Japan, is characterized by its round, spherical shape and vivid blue surface. Fukuyama City produces the largest amount of arrowhead in Japan, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries' \"Survey on Regional Vegetable Production in Japan in 2018\". It is also referred to as the \"sapphire of the rice field\" due to its beautiful color. Arrowhead is a nutritious root vegetable that is rich in protein and potassium. It has a dusty texture and a sweet taste with a slightly bitter aftertaste. In Japanese cuisine, it is considered a lucky food and is often served during festive occasions. Fukuyama's arrowhead is particularly famous and is in high demand as an ingredient in Osechi dishes. The best time to get shipments of this root vegetable is between November and December. The mild Seto Inland Sea climate of Fukuyama is perfect for growing blue arrowhead. Its cultivation began around 1902 when it grew wild in a swampy area in present-day Senda-cho, Fukuyama City. Later on, it was brought to the fertile moat around Fukuyama Castle. During the Edo period, the Fukuyama clan built additional irrigation canals to convey water from the Ashida River to the new rice paddies. This provided a plentiful supply of water, which helped the cultivation of arrowhead to flourish in Fukuyama.",

In this way, kudzu powder made of 100% kudzu starch is called \"Yoshino honkudzu\". In addition, the method of exposing it to cold water many times during the harsh winter is called the Yoshino Zarashi method and is a traditional manufacturing method that has continued since the Edo period. The cold and high-quality water of the Yoshino region of Nara Prefecture produces high-quality kudzu powder.In addition to kuzumochi, kudzu powder is widely used in other dishes and sweets, such as sesame tofu, kuzuyu, kuzu bun, kuzu noodles, and as a thickening agent.",

This freshwater shrimp is about 9 cm long and is characterized by its long scissors, which are 1.5 times longer than its body length. The Shimanto River is inhabited mainly by two species of shrimp, the southern prawn and the Yamato prawn. Even today, the traditional fishing method \"Shibazuke fishing\", which takes advantage of the nocturnal nature of the fish, has been handed down. \"Shibazuke fishing\" is done using traps made of leafy bush branches and bamboos about one meter long. If the trap is left submerged at some depth near the mouth of the river for at least one day and night, the river shrimp will think it is a hiding place and take the trap. A long time ago, catching river shrimps in summer was a staple of children's river trips, and the shrimps became a side dish for dinner.The most common way to eat them is to take advantage of the flavor of the ingredients. Grilled or fried without peeling the skin, you can enjoy its crunchy texture and savory flavor. Another typical recipe is \"Kyuuri to Kawa-Ebi no Nimono\". It is said that \"Kyuuri to Kawa-Ebi no Nimono\" originated with fishermen who fished for river shrimp.",

This is then laid on top of vinegared sushi rice in a serving box, along with stewed vegetables such as carrots or shiitake mushrooms, to make hakozushi - literally, box sushi. When the Buddhist priest Nichiren was exiled to Izu by the Kamakura shogunate in 1261, the fishermen who sheltered him gave him his morning and evening meals in multi-tiered boxes.

Grilled head of tuna is a local delicacy in Misaki: a hearty dish where, as the name suggests, an entire tuna head is grilled as-is. It originally arose from the fishermen of Misaki when they boarded their boats and set out for the open sea. They would suspend tuna heads that they could not sell at market from their ships' funnels, grilling it in covered pans before eating it. It was also enjoyed by the young fishermen as an accompaniment to drinks when they came home to port. Restaurants near Misaki Harbor are said to have begun offering grilled tuna head to the general public about 40 years ago. With the gigantic tuna head served on the table, the dish has a big impact, and is especially enjoyed by tourists. It is also attractive as an opportunity to taste rare cuts that are seldom used in more common tuna dishes, such as the cheeks and the meat inside the eye sockets.With geographical features suitable for a port, Misaki developed long ago as a location for offshore and coastal fishing, and became known nationwide in the early Showa era as a base for deep sea fishing, with a flourishing trade in tuna. Nowadays, various kinds of tuna caught all over the world are frozen at -60°C onboard fishing ships, then brought to the port before being shipped through fish markets, mainly to the Tokyo Metropolitan area. Misaki's fish markets sell between 400 and 1000 tuna a day.",

With the meaning of \"attracting good fortune,\" persimmons are in demand as gifts at the end of the year and as good luck charms for New Year's. The scene of \"Makigaki\" being made is newsworthy at this time of the year.Dried persimmons are made from a specialty astringent persimmon called \"nayaboshi,\" which is rubbed by hand three times while being dried to get the right shape, and are ready when the surface is covered with white powder (fructose). To make \"Makigaki (rolled persimmons)\", cut the shaft and tip of a dried persimmon, slit it open lengthwise, carefully remove the seeds, stack 10 or more (depending on the size of the persimmon) in a rugby ball shape, wrap them in a bamboo skin, wrap them in straw, and then roll them up with a rope, using a lot of force to make it go round and round. A good indicator of a well-done product is that when cut, the brown color of the dried persimmon and the layer of white flour show up well and look like a rose flower. The unique flavor and natural sweetness of the dried persimmon is like a high-class Japanese confectionary. Production begins around July with removing the bark of the main bamboo and weaving rice straw while waiting for the dried persimmons to be ready and finished by the end of the year. While there are no differences among regions or producers in the way they wrap the bamboo skin, there are differences in the way they roll it up with a rope (straw or rush grass). In the past, persimmons were often seen hanging under the eaves of houses, but the number of producers of \"Makigaki (rolled persimmons)\" has been decreasing over the years.",

These regions market their mushrooms as \"Tamba matsutake,\" known for their fragrant aroma and elastic texture. The scent is particularly prized, and it's often said that a car filled with freshly harvested Tamba matsutake will be permeated with its rich fragrance. Matsutake is also produced in the Yamashiro region, in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, and is sold as \"Yamashiro matsutake.\" Its taste and flavor are considered on par with Tamba matsutake.Before World War II, the prefecture's matsutake production exceeded 1200 tons per year. However, in recent years, this number has plummeted to just a few tons. A significant factor contributing to this decline is the lifestyle changes resulting from rapid economic growth. As the use of electricity, oil, and propane has increased, pine leaves and branches are no longer utilized as fuel. This leaves more pine forests untouched, creating an environment in which matsutake, preferring dry and arid soil, struggles to grow amidst various trees and weeds. Furthermore, recent insect damage to pine trees has caused many trees to die, further aggravating the decline in production. Even today, cultivating matsutake remains unfeasible. Maintaining mountains and pine forests to foster favorable growing conditions is still necessary. In response, a project to improve the matsutake environment was initiated across the prefecture in 1978 (Showa 53), involving measures such as the removal of mid-layer trees and humus. This is known as the \"Kyoto method.\"Against this backdrop, kyoto's matsutake is highly valued as a premium ingredient. When the season arrives in the fall, it's served in ryotei and kappo restaurants in dishes like “matsutake rice”, “osumashi”, and “sukiyaki”.",

Soseki was delighted with the dish and consumed it without spilling a single morsel. Shiki also loved Matsuyama zushi and even wrote a haiku titled \"I love Matsuyama sushi.\" Later, in the spring of 1895, Soseki returned to Matsuyama as a teacher at Matsuyama Junior High School and ordered Matsuyama zushi as soon as he arrived. This indicates that it was one of his favorite dishes in Matsuyama. Matsuyama zushi is also known as \"moburi-zushi\", which is derived from the Matsuyama dialect word \"mobusu\" or \"moburu\", which means \"to mix together.\"",

For that reason, “cocoons” became highly valued and indispensable in the sericulture industry, and “cocoon balls,” an event food made from rolling right flour, millet flour, and corn flour became popular. However, unlike many other local delicacies, rather than being made for immediate consumption, cocoon balls are traditionally served as offerings. For example, on January 13, two days before the Little New Year festival, it is customary to make cocoon balls from millet flour and attach them to the branches of mulberry trees, resembling flowers. Additionally, Hatsuuma, a celebration of the first day of the ox in February, is a day for plentiful silkworm harvests within Agatsuma County, Gunma. 16 cocoon balls are made and offered to shrines and wells. It could be said that these customs show vividly the value people place on the cocoons that bolster the sericulture industry.",

Ingredients vary from region to region and from household to household, such as konjac(=yam cake) and \"kamaboko(=fish cake)\", sea bream and maki mussels in areas near the sea, and plenty of daikon radish during the daikon radish harvest season. Rokka Shrine in Shimorokka, Kashima Town, holds an annual autumn festival on October 17 to pray for a bountiful harvest, during which each household makes \"Gumeshi (Mazemeshi)\" and serves it to gathered relatives and neighbors. Instead of chicken, it uses horse meat, a specialty of the prefecture, and seasonal vegetables such as gobou(=burdock), dried shiitake mushrooms, konjac(=yam cake), and carrots, which are stir-fried and seasoned with soy sauce and sugar, and mixed with white rice.The \"Shishimai\" dedicated at this festival is the first important intangible cultural asset in Kumamoto Prefecture, and is derived from Kiyomasa Kato's tiger hunting, and depicts a child growing up to become a warrior and bravely fighting a lion. On Tobase Island, located halfway between the Uto Peninsula and Amakusa, there is a mixed rice dish called \"birin meshi\" that uses tofu instead of meat. The name comes from the sound made when the tofu is stir-fried to remove the water. It was served at Buddhist ceremonies as a vegetarian dish.",

It has also spread throughout the region as a festive dish to celebrate the regular festival at Kawaguchi Asama Shrine in Fujikawaguchiko Town. Memaki's triangle shape is said to represent Mount Fuji, while the toothpick used to hold the arame kelp wrapping is said to signify the pilgrim's staff used to climb Mount Fuji. These may also convey the religious belief in Mount Fuji and a prayer for safety in climbing the mountain. Because the arame kelp used as an ingredient is very hard, it must be simmered for several days. However, this serves to preserve the dish, and it was once used as a convenient portable food for climbing Mount Fuji. In addition, memaki's triangle shape mimics the shape of the kimono worn by the enshrined deity, the goddess of Fuji Lady Konohanasakuyahime.",

What makes this soup different from a traditional Tonjiru or pork miso soup is that it uses sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. There are no strict rules governing which root vegetables are to be used however, so this dish is enjoyed by households all throughout the prefecture.The unique name is said to come from phrases such as “Yatara Mettara Gu Wo Ireru (Randomly add ingredients)” and “Yatara Mettara Gu Wo Kiru (Randomly cut the ingredients)”. The reason for adding so many ingredients was said to be started by farmers who wanted a way to use up the large quantity of vegetables that had been harvested. In his representative work “Kabi”, announced in 1894 by Shusei Tokuda; a renowned literary of the prefecture, there is a scene depicting the main character and their friends preparing and eating Mettajiru. The sweet potatoes which are also used in Mettarjiru are recognized to be a part of the “Kaga Yasai” brand vegetables promoted by the city of Kanazawa. There is a long history of cultivating sweet potato in the city of Kanazawa, as it is said the seed potato and method of cultivation was introduced from Satsuma near the end of the Genroku period. By 1877, the area had become a full-fledged production center of the product and by 1938, over 100 tons of early dug sweet potatoes had been shipped to cities like Kyoto, Hikone, Osaka, Tsuruga, and Kobe. In 1977, following the introduction of curing storage (a method of mass storage under conditions of high heat and humidity), the sweet potato had become one of the main vegetables of the sand dune regions of northern Kanazawa.",

Mizunazuki\" is another local confection traditionally eaten throughout the prefecture. It is made of white Uiro (rice cake) topped with azuki beans and cut into triangles.During the Heian period (794-1185), the court people used to take a sip of ice stored in an icehouse in the Nishigamo district of Kyoto's Kita Ward to get rid of the heat. At that time, ice was a luxury item, and the common people rarely had the opportunity to eat it. It is said that this is why people began to eat \"mizunashi\" (waterless moon), which is shaped like ice.In Kyoto, on June 30, \"Nagoshi-no-harae,\" a Shinto ritual to purify the \"sins and impurities\" of the six months from January to June, is held at shrines in various parts of the city. During this ritual, mizunagetsu is eaten to drive away sins and pray for good health and good fortune. The triangular shape of mizunashizuki is a symbol of ice to ward off the heat, and the red color of the azuki beans is meant to drive away evil spirits.Kyoto Prefecture has designated mizunazuki as a \"traditional Kyoto food\" as it is an artistic food based on the culture of the imperial court and the tea ceremony nurtured in Kyoto.

It is said that because the original Dutch word 'aardappel' was difficult to pronounce it was changed to 'kanpura,' and the cities of Koriyama, Minamisoma, and Iwaki are cited as its main areas of production. 'Miso kanpura' is made by frying kanpura with the skin still on together with miso, sugar, mirin, and other ingredients. A farmer came up with the idea for the dish to be eaten at home, as they produced potatoes that were so small they couldn't be shipped out.The sweet miso seasoning makes it a perfect snack and a dish that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.Other local dishes that use kanpura include 'kanpura botamochi,' which is made by mashing kanpura, making it into balls, and dressing them with miso.",

Many farmers made their own miso, which was also called \"Inaka miso (Country miso)\". Barley miso is made by adding barley malt and salt to soybeans, and is produced mainly in the Setouchi area, as well as in Ehime and Yamaguchi prefectures, and throughout Kyushu. Other types of miso include \"Komemiso (Rice miso)\", \"Mamemiso (Soybean miso)\", and \"Awasemiso (Mixed miso)\", which is a mixture of the two. Among them, Ehime's barley miso is characterized by its mellow aroma and elegant sweetness compared to other miso because of its high malted due to the abundant use of barley. In addition, barley miso is rich in dietary fiber and protein and is expected to help control cholesterol and prevent arteriosclerosis, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction. This miso soup made with barley miso is a healthy and nutritious dish, and is a standard home-style dish in Ehime Prefecture.",

In Ōtake City, it is enjoyed during events such as the anniversary of the famous monk Kōbō Daishi and the equinoctial week gatherings in spring and autumn. Durring community gatherings or when celebrating a newly built home, large round rice balls are distributed to the neighborhood.A similar dish called \"Moburi-zu\" (Matsuyama vinegar) exists in Ehime Prefecture. While sharing the same name's origin, this dish involves making sushi rice using a sweetened vinegar made from small fish found in the Seto Inland Sea, such as grub fish and lizard fish, and then arranging seasonal small fish like conger eel on top. Unlike the recognition of Hiroshima's \"Moburi\" as a mixed rice dish, Ehime's version is considered \"chirashi sushi\", raw fish served in a bowl on top of rice.There is also a dish called \"Moburi\" in Sukumo City, Kochi Prefecture, where it involves mixing cooked rice with simmered daikon radish, burdock root, and carrots, topped with lightly grilled dried seaweed.",

Around the 1950s, when food was scarce, simple monjayaki, made by dissolving udon flour and adding soy sauce and syrup, was widely popular among children. From the end of the Edo period to the Meiji era (1868-1912), when supplies were scarce, children who did not have easy access to paper and calligraphy tools would write letters on a griddle with dough made from wheat flour dissolved in water to teach and play with, hence the name \"mojiyaki.\" The word \"moji\" turned to \"monja\" and changed to \"monja . With the postwar economic growth, monja evolved by adding ingredients such as cabbage, corn and fried eggs, but at the same time, the number of dagashiya, which children had grown familiar with, declined dramatically. Several monjayaki stores sprang up in an attempt to preserve the taste familiar from childhood, and monjayaki has transformed into a snack for adults, and continues to this day.The essential ingredients for monjayaki are a teppan and a spatula. Monjayaki is usually eaten by scooping a small amount from the outside of the dough and pressing it against the teppan to char it, but nowadays there are so many different variations of ingredients that one can enjoy a variety of tastes and monja textures.",

Made by simmering salmon shark in soy sauce and sugar to make it tender, Moro no Nitsuke is a home-cooked dish well-known in Tochigi.Shark dishes were commonly consumed in inland areas far from the sea and were a valuable source of protein for the folks there. This is because shark meat was neither popular nor widely consumed by people near fishing ports where sharks were caught. Sharks store uric acid in their bodies, which disperses and turns into ammonia when they die, making them less prone to spoilage. This made sharks perfect for transporting to inland areas where fresh seafood was scarce, and they were highly valued in inland areas as the only type of fresh fish they could get from the sea.In addition to moro, sagambo (Pacific spiny dogfish) is also eaten in Tochigi, and both have become traditional local flavors that are often served in Tochigi households.",

Later, the combination of pork, onions, and mustard that has now come to be known as \"Muroran yakitori,\" took root in the city.At that time, there were many food stalls offering grilled pork skewers in the Wanishi-cho area of Muroran City, which was prospering with steel mills. \"Toriyoshi\", which is said to be the pioneer of \"Muroran Yakitori\", also opened a store in Wanishi-cho in 1937.\"Muroran Yakitori\" is characterized by its use of onions instead of leeks.

In the past they were also known as “field planting bochi (tanue bochi)” or “field break bochi (nokyuumi bochi).”The myoga leaves essential for making myogabochi have antimicrobial properties, making them suitable as portable snacks during the perishable early summer to summer season. This reflects the wisdom of our ancestors from an era before refrigeration and food preservation devices were available. Additionally, the broad beans used for the bean paste contain iron and protein, making it an ideal snack for replenishing energy and healing fatigue during agricultural work.",

Fresh shirasu lose their freshness quickly and can only be eaten on the same day of landing.In the Shonan area, shirasu fishing was already practiced during the Edo period. In the beginning, it was common to process the shirasu into \"tami-iwashi,\" which was spread out in a rectangular box and dried in the sun, and kama-age shirasu was only for fishermen's private consumption. With the development of kettle cooking and refrigeration technology, kama-age shirasu and raw shirasu came to be processed and sold directly, and became popular as a local specialty. The fishing grounds are located in Sagami Bay in the southern part of the prefecture. Because the fishing grounds for shirasu are formed near the coast, it is possible to land the fish quickly and with excellent freshness.

A fish with thick and filling meat, it is said that it came to be served over the New Year because it is deemed to be auspicious for the prosperity of descendants due to its increased number of offspring in winter and also, because the eggs are golden in color, it is auspicious for business prosperity as well.The slime flounder is low-calorie and easy to digest, and it is effective for recovering physical strength when one’s stomach is in poor condition too. It can be said that it is the best fish to eat during the year-end and New Year holidays when we tend to eat too much and get tired.In fact, it is only recently that the slime flounder came to be eaten on New Year's Eve. From the Edo period to the prewar period, cod was the New Year's fish in Sendai. This can be observed in the letter written by Date Masamune, who was worried that cod would not be available in the castle town on New Year's Day, instructing his vassals to investigate the reason why cod caught by fishermen was not being shipped (refer to “History of Sendai City”), as well as a document from before World War II describing annual events in Sendai stating that cod soup is indispensable for the New Year (refer to Sendai Castle Town “Townspeople Retsuden”).

This removes most of the moisture, allowing it to be stored in a cool, dark place without direct sunlight for 2-3 months at room temperature. It's so renowned for enhancing broth that it's referred to as \"dashi-age,\" and it's a must-add ingredient in miso soup and simmered dishes in the Nankansen region. A similar type of fried tofu exists in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, in Shikoku, and Nankan-Age is said to have originated from Matsuyama.\"Nankan-Agemaki Sushi\" involves using oil-drained Nankan-Age that has been simmered in a sweet and savory mixture of dashi, soy sauce, and sugar, as a substitute for nori seaweed. After squeezing out excess liquid from the simmered ingredients, the sushi rice is spread on a bamboo mat, the simmered ingredients (shiitake mushrooms, carrots, tamagoyaki, etc.) are placed on top, and then it's rolled. Unlike with nori seaweed, it's a bit trickier to stick the rice together and to tighten the end of the roll. This dish is often handcrafted in eateries and delis.

The name \"narezushi\" is derived from the process of becoming accustomed or matured as fermentation progresses.

This preservation method is exemplified by Shiga Prefecture's \"funazushi,\" known as \"honnare.\" However, during the Muromachi period, a shorter fermentation process emerged, allowing both rice and fish to be consumed together, known as \"namanare.\" This led to the consumption of rice with a sour taste. In Mie Prefecture, all \"narezushi\" is of the \"namanare\" type. Variations exist among regions, including differences in the types of fish used, pickling methods, purposes of pickling, and the timing of pickling. Particularly, some types are pickled for Shinto shrines' \"jukusen\" (specially prepared meals offered to deities). The types of fish used also vary by region; in Ise City, ayu, sea bream, and horse mackerel are common, while in the eastern Kishu region, in addition to ayu, Pacific saury, mackerel, barracuda, and others are used.

    "history": "Vegetables grown in Kanazawa city using traditional methods are called “Kaga Yasai”. Yasai is the Japanese word for vegetable. Vegetables that can be sold under the brand name “Kaga Yasai” are those that are locally grown and have been produced since 1945 or before that. Currently, there are 15 different types of vegetables being sold under the brand name. Some examples are, Kaga Fat Cucumber, Gensuke Daikon, “Aka Zuiki” (=red taro stem), “Kinjisou” (=type of spinach), and Amaguri Kabocha (=red kuri squash).Heta Murasaki Nasu is also a Kaga Yasai and is a locally grown eggplant. Heta Murasaki means purple stem in Japanese and the vegetable has a bright purple stem as seen in its name. The body of the eggplant is oval shaped like an egg. The glossy skin of the eggplant is thin and the fruit inside is soft and sweet. This vegetable is popular because it keeps well for a long time. Heta Murasaki Nasu was first grown around 1945. It is said that Heta Murasaki Nasu was made using an eggplant named Ogi grown in the Arimatsu and Izumi areas of Kanazawa city. At the beginning of the Showa period, the main producers of Heta Murasaki Nasu became the Kinjo and Sakiura areas as it is known today.“Nasu no orandani” is eaten during the harvest season of eggplants. Depending on the family that makes it, the eggplants are either boiled, deep-fried, or stir fried. This dish is made when there is plenty of eggplants to go around, in order to not waste them. Heta Murasaki Nasu is perfect for this dish because it does not become dissolved even when simmered for a long time. Oranda means Holland in Japanese and this dish is said to have gotten its name because it uses the same cooking methods that were used in Nagasaki, a region influenced by Dutch culture.",

As well as pickled persimmons, there are a variety of raw pickles such as natazuke, named after the thick bladed hatchets (the kind normally used to remove tree branches) that are used to roughly chop the daikon.The forestry industry was very successful in Akita due to the prefecture having a number of different types of timber including natural Akita cedar, thus it was very common for households to own a hatchet.. As cutting daikon with a hatchet causes the flesh to fray when coming in contact with the blade, the flavors sink deep into it, even when cut into thick pieces. A distinct characteristic of natazuke is that it retains the quality of the daikon’s crunchy texture and the natural sweetness of koji (malted rice).Gakko are so essential to the people of Akita prefecture that apart from being used for everyday meals, bento boxes, as well as accompaniments for alcohol, eating gakko with tea is such a popular way to enjoy them that they have the phrase “gakko chakko” (gakko and tea).",

During the military campaign of 1083-1087, which took place in Yokote City, farmers delivered boiled beans wrapped in straw to Minamoto no Yoshie's side, which was struggling with the supply of goods. The farmers tried it and found it tasty. This legend led to the erection of a monument in Kanazawa Park in Yokote City.Mushrooms and wild vegetables, which are the main ingredients, are picked in spring or fall, stored in salted storage, and used after removing the salt when making natto soup. Because of the time-consuming nature of this dish, it has taken root as a dish for ceremonial occasions such as weddings and funerals.In the inland areas of the southern part of the prefecture, natto soup is popular among men and women of all ages, and many people look forward to eating it in the winter.",

In the Murayama area of Oe Town, fermented soybeans without strings are made into \"Natto Jiru” (natto soup). “Natto Jiru” is a winter home-style dish that has been popular in Yamagata Prefecture for a long time. Natto is milled in a mortar until it becomes completely creamy, then thickened and blended into the soup. “Imogara”, made from dried stems of Karatori potatoes, is an indispensable ingredient in “Natto Jiru”. It was a valuable source of protein with plenty of tofu and fried tofu, along with dried and salted products and other preserved foods. It is eaten on the day of Nanakusa (January 7) in the Murayama area, on New Year's Day in the Mogami area, and in the Shonai area, it is sometimes eaten on \"Daikoku-sama no Otoshiya (New Year's Eve of God of Wealth)\" (December 9).",

Because its otolith bone is larger than those of other fish, it cannot be eaten whole from the head even though it is a small fish, so the head is removed and eaten. It is in season from May to September, and is selected as one of the \"Bingo Fish\" by fishermen in the Bingo area (Mihara City, Onomichi City, Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture; Kasaoka City, Okayama Prefecture) who choose representative fish of their area. Deep-fried nebuto is made by dipping nebuto in potato starch and deep frying it, making it a snackable dish. It is popular as a snack for children and as a snack for alcoholic beverages. In 2021, Fukuyama City held a \"Fukutsumami General Election,\" a competition to determine the ranking of \"Fukuzumami,\" snacks made from the city's specialties, and \"Nebuto no Nanbanzuke\" was chosen as the fourth place winner, making it one of The Big Four .",

Fukaya uses green onions in many dishes such as negiyaki pancakes, which truly bring out the flavor of green onions, or shiraae salad, nanbanzuke marinated meat, etc. Green onions are especially indispensable in niboto, a noodle dish that is part of Fukaya’s regional cuisine. Neginuta is another dish using green onions which is a must at all celebrations. Winter green onions in particular have a mouthfeel that heightens the sweetness of any dish and pairs deliciously with the flavors of vinegared miso, creating an exceptional taste.

The winters of the Hida Region were cold and severe, and there was a lack of fresh vegetables and basic food, so people cured, dried, and fermented their food. A culture of food preservation took root, and thus nezushi became a familiar dish among the people.When December arrives, every household prepares salted trout and malted rice, then begins to thoroughly cure the nezushi. The person preparing the nezushi adds malted rice to regular rice, and mixes in the trout, radish, and carrots. Then, it is set aside to cure for about 15 to 20 days―after which it is ready. Varieties of fermented sushi exist all across Japan, and while many people don’t like their peculiar taste, it is said that nezushi has a sweet and sour flavor that is mild and easy to eat.",

The dish is similar to \"nikomi\" in Kyushu, but differs in that the chicken, root vegetables, and other ingredients are cut into 1 cm cubes. There are two theories as to why the ingredients are cut into small pieces: one is that it is to make it easier to eat according to the size of the peanuts, and the other is that it is the result of the wisdom of the people in the past that was inherited to minimize the waste of ingredients.",

Even within a region, there are distinctive flavors depending on the area, such as miso flavor, soy sauce flavor, or both. The origin of the name “nigomi udon” is said to be because the soup becomes “cloudy (nigoru),” or it is said to be a corruption of “nikomi (stewed) udon.”Since the Tsukui region was unsuitable for rice cultivation, the cultivation of wheat and barley has been popular since ancient times, and udon noodles made from wheat flour have been eaten almost every day. Noodles were handmade in each household, and in the 1940s, when noodle machines were introduced, it is said that people would sometimes bring flour to local noodle factories to have the noodles made for them. Until around 1965, nigomi udon was frequently served as a regular home-cooked meal. However, in recent years, due to changes in eating habits, opportunities to eat it at home have decreased significantly. As a result of the efforts of the local Chamber of Commerce to preserve the traditional taste, it is now served at restaurants in the area.",

    "history": "“Niku Tofu” is a simple dish made of beef, tofu, and green onions. The green onions used in the dish are often “kujo green onions”, a traditional vegetable of Kyoto. These onions are leaf onions (green onions) whose green leaves are eaten. Legend has it that in 771, when the Fushimi Inari Shrine was built, Hata Irogu planted green onions brought from Naniwa. These seeds have been passed down and protected by farmers from generation to generation, earning it the nickname \"king of green onions\". According to one theory, the name comes from the fact that high-quality green onions were grown in the Kujo area during the Heian period. The tender leaf is slimy, sweet, and fragrant which makes it a popular ingredient for a wide range of dishes including as a condiment, nabe (one-pot dish), sukiyaki, simmered dishes, salad, and miso soup. Although it is grown year-round, it is in season in winter when it is slimy and sweet.The history of beef in Kyoto is long and rich, with \"Tamba beef\" being mentioned in Japan's oldest wagyu book, \"Kokugyu Juzu,\" drawn in 1310. In the early Meiji period, sukiyaki restaurants were established in Kyoto City. Today, Kyoto Prefecture and the Kyoto Beef Distribution Promotion Council have branded high-grade beef produced and raised in the prefecture as \"Kyoto Meat\". To qualify for this prestigious classification, the breed must be Japanese black cattle, the cattle must have been raised in Kyoto for the longest period of time, and the meat must be processed at the Kyoto City Central Wholesale Market No. 2.The water used for daily life in Kyoto is soft, which means that it is low in minerals and has no peculiar taste. This unique characteristic is believed to be the reason for producing delicious tofu.",

Mame miso is made by breeding koji mold on soybeans to make soybean koji, then fermenting and aging for a long time. It is aged for a minimum of one year, up to two to three years. Mame miso made in this way has a rich body, acidity, and a unique astringent flavor. Hatcho miso is a brand of mame miso. Hatcho miso originated in Hatcho Village(current name: Hatcho-cho, Okazaki City), located eight units of distance (Hatcho) away from Okazaki Castle, birthplace of Tokugawa Ieyasu. As the key transportation point at the intersection of the Tokaido and Yahagi River, it was said to be an easy place to obtain the ingredients for miso, such as soybeans and salt. The culture of mame miso has remained firmly rooted to this day, with a variety of miso dishes that are known even outside of the prefecture. Along with \"Miso Nikomi Udon,\" \"Miso Oden,\" and \"Miso Katsu,\" \"Nimiso\" is beloved among residents of Aichi Prefecture. This dish is also known as \"Misoni\" (miso-simmered), and as the name suggests, it is made by simmering various ingredients in miso. The flavor and cooking method differ by household, with countless variations. In some places, it is eaten as a stew, and in other places, more broth is added to make it more like hot pot or miso soup.

Taina was introduced from China in the early Meiji period and was bred to be adapted to Niigata. It is widely used as one of the Nagaoka vegetables. Depending on the region, nozawana or radish leaves are used as well. Nozawana is used in the Uonuma and Joetsu regions. A long time ago, each household would pickle them in autumn and eat them during winter when there were no green vegetables.For salted taina, remove the salt before cooking. Cut the desalted taina into bite-sized pieces, stir-fry in oil, and simmer in dashi stock, soy sauce, or miso. The standard ingredient added inside is uchimame, but other ingredients that can be put inside include carrots, burdock root, and fried tofu. Uchimame is made by pounding soybeans and crushing them into flat pieces. Wash the soybeans, soak them in lukewarm water at about 40 degrees for 10 minutes, drain the water in a colander, and place them on a hard board or stone mill (or flat stone). Pound each one with a mallet to a thickness of 2 to 3 mm. Unlike when they are whole beans, they are thinner and cook quickly, so they are also used in stews, stir-fries, vinegared dishes, miso soup, and so on.In addition, the dashi stock varies depending on the household, such as using dried sardines, dried bonito flakes, or dried scallops, and the single term “nina” can refer to many different variations, from the cooking method to the selection of ingredients.",

The small daikons were cut into strips and made into dried daikons. In addition to preserving it, drying it out reduces the water content and concentrates flavor, sweetness and its nutritional value, including calcium. There is also a method of preserving fresh daikons by burying them in the snow to provide food until spring.

From the Edo Period through the Meiji Period, it was one of the foodstuff that was brought by merchant fleet and cargo ships which came and went between Hokkaido and Kansai; it was made much of in Kyoto City, which was inland and where it was difficult to obtain seafood. Regional cuisines that use herring have many divergences; that is one such circumstance. It is a traditional ingredient indispensable to Kyoto, used for example in “yaki nishin” where mirin and soy sauce are poured over herring and then grilled, “nishin soba” where herring is arranged on soba, ”nishin no konnmaki” where herring is wrapped in kombu seaweed and then stewed, and more.“Nishin nasu” becomes a delicacy when using “Yamashina eggplant” or “Kamo eggplant” which are Kyoto City’s native species. “Yamashina eggplant” outdid other varieties during the end of the Meiji Period to the beginning of the Showa Period, and at one point it made up 60-70% of the eggplant cultivated in the city. Its characteristic is its soft, melt-in-your mouth flesh. ”Kamo eggplant” is a type of round eggplant made from long ago in Kamigamo, Kita Ward. It has hard, tight flesh and is sweet.Vegetables cultivated within Kyoto Prefecture from long ago are designated “Kyo no dento yasai” (Kyoto’s traditional vegetables), and are seeking branding.

Kyoto is famous for herring soba, but it has also been eaten in Hokkaido for a long time. Kyoto's \"Nishin soba\" is lightly seasoned with kombu seaweed and light soy sauce, while in Hokkaido, it is seasoned strongly, resulting in a slightly sweet soup.From the late Edo period to the Meiji period, herring fishing was popular along the coast of Hokkaido. In spring, when large schools of herring rush to the coast to spawn, a phenomenon known as “kuki” in which the sea was dyed pure white could be observed. In the Edo period, when freezing technology was not yet developed, large quantities of herring were dried and preserved as migaki herring so that they could be kept for a long time. \"Migaki herring\", which is a source of protein, became a valuable preserved food nationwide and was transported from Hokkaido to Honshu on \"Kitamae ships\". In this way, large amounts of \"Migaki herring\" were transported to Kyoto and other areas, and herring cuisine evolved outside of Hokkaido as well.During the Meiji period, herring catches peaked, but from around the 1950s onwards, the occurrences of \"kuki\" decreased sharply, and herring became almost impossible to catch. However, due to the remnants of its heyday, there are still herring dishes using \"Migaki herring\", such as \"Nishin soba\", in Hokkaido, Kyoto, and other parts of the country.\"Nishin soba\" is said to have originated in Kyoto, but Hokkaido's \"Nishin soba\" is said to have its roots in a recipe handed down by\" the Yokoyama family\" , who were fishermen when herring fishing flourished in Esashi.",

From the late Edo period (around 1750) to the Meiji period (1868 - 1912), the herring fishery in Hokkaido, especially on the Sea of Japan side, was at the height of its prosperity. In spring, when large schools of herring come to the coast to spawn (which is called “Kuki”), the sea is often seen to be dyed white. The catch of herring reached its peak in the Meiji period, and at one time there were nearly one million tons of herring caught, but from around 1960, the herring population declined rapidly and the catch of herring was almost non-existent. At present, the herring, which are established in and around lakes and marshes such as Akkeshiko (Lake Akkeshi), are often caught, but the catches are nowhere near as large as they were in their heyday. “Nishin Zuke” is a local dish that has been made in households since the days when fishing for herring was at its peak. In those days, storing food to get through the cold winter was important, and pickles were used as one way to preserve it. It was made by marinating dried herring and vegetables together before winter arrives, which became known as \"Nishin Zuke\". The catch of herring has decreased, but it is still a winter family dish in Hokkaido.",

Whenever there was a celebration or a guest was invited, the chicken was first slaughtered, and the meat and entrails were used for \"Tori meshi\" or \"game-ni\", and the rest of the chicken bones was used for \"Niwatori Jiru\".The broth is made from the chicken bones as well as the meat, so there is no waste and the ingredients can be enjoyed to the fullest. Along with \"Niwatori Jiru\", \"Tori meshi\" is another chicken dish. This is a rice dish with stewed chicken, Gobou(=Burdock), carrots, and other ingredients mixed in. The leftover pieces of meat and entrails from making \"Tori meshi\" are sometimes used for \"Niwatori Jiru\". For this reason, \"Tori meshi\" and \"Niwatori Jiru\" were often made as a set.",

    "history": "Nokpe\" is a typical Niigata home-style dish and a local delicacy found throughout Japan. Unlike \"Nogei-jiru\" found throughout the country, Niigata's \"Nogpe\" is more of a stew than a soup. The main ingredient is taro, and vegetables and mushrooms are simmered in a light flavor and thickened with saya-endo (pea pods) as the green seasoning. In winter, when saya-endo is unavailable, \"to-tomame\" is sprinkled on top of the taro. Totto-mame\" are salmon roe. The roe is broken into pieces, mixed with salt, stored, and boiled to use as needed.In Niigata, where it snows deeply, people used to make a lot of it on days when they could not even go shopping, and store the whole pot in the snow, using the snow as a refrigerator. Perhaps as a remnant of this tradition, \"nokpe\" is sometimes eaten cold. In the old days, scallops were used for the broth, but nowadays chicken or fresh makizake salmon are sometimes added in small pieces. Some use a lot of taro to thicken the broth, some use potato starch, some use a lot of broth, and some use a little. The ingredients, the way they are cut, the way they are made, and the way they are eaten are all varied and unique to each family. Nokpei\" has been passed down from mother to child as the taste of the home, and has been eaten since ancient times, and is well known as Niigata's mother's favorite food.",

In other words, it is an indispensable part of everyday life.Since “Noppei” is often made during winters, in the Hagi region the primary ingredients became root vegetables such as satoimo, gobo, renkon, and carrots, commonly resulting in a slightly thickened sauce. In the past, kudzu starch was used as a thickening agent, but nowadays the use of potato starch or wheat flour is more common. In Hagi, when serving “Noppei” at Buddhist ceremonial events, it is prepared as a vegetarian dish, often by omitting the chicken and adding ginkgo nuts. In the neighboring village of Fukue (now incorporated as a part of Hagi), it was prepared with excess broth.",

In the Iga region, Matsuo Basho invited disciples to a \"Tsukimi no Kai\" (moon-viewing gathering) in 1694, and the menu included \"Fu no Noppei,\" which remains only in the menu name.

Norabouna was historically grown to extract oil, and farmers practiced self-seeding for personal use. Known for its strong vitality, it is said to have saved many lives during the great famine of the Edo period. Currently, it is cultivated in various areas, including the northern part of Kawasaki City, including the Suge area, and Odawara City in Kanagawa Prefecture, as well as in other prefectures such as Hiki District in Saitama Prefecture and Akiruno City in Tokyo.Belonging to the Brassicaceae family, norabouna has a unique bitterness with minimal astringency, offering a faint sweetness, tender texture, and a distinctive feature of being able to consume the flower stalks (to). When the main stem is deeply pruned about 10 centimeters above the ground surface initially, subsequent side shoots can be harvested four or five times. Local farmer Takashi Takahashi created this cultivation method around 2000 and actively shared it with neighboring farmers. During the same period, local farmers, business associations, and others collaborated to develop products such as castella and tofu using norabouna. This initiative helped transition norabouna, which had previously been primarily for personal use by farmers, into a more widely recognized vegetable.A popular way to enjoy norabouna is in ohitashi, a simple dish that allows you to savor the fragrance, sweetness, and texture of the ingredient.",

Since the land was unsuitable for rice paddies, wheat and buckwheat were the main crops grown in Okutama, and a culture of eating udon and buckwheat flour had taken root in Okutama. In addition, the mountains were cold from late fall through winter. When the men came home hungry after a day's work in the mountains, they would make a quick and warm dish, and so noshikomi udon was prepared and eaten in every household.The word \"noshikomi\" comes from \"stretch\" = \"stretch and spread\" after the udon has been pounded, but in some areas it is called \"zuridashi udon\" because it is eaten by slipping it out of the pot. The noodles are characterized by their wide width, similar to Hoto in Yamanashi, and are served hot after being simmered in a pot with soup stock (niboshi), shiitake mushrooms, freshly pounded udon noodles, and seasonal vegetables, in the Okutama style. The sweetness of the vegetables soaks into the udon, warming the body and soul. Until around 1975 in the Showa era, wild boars and deer caught by hunting, and chickens that were cut up at home were sometimes added to the soup.",

When simmering sardines, mackerel, and other bluefish, a handful of this well-seasoned part of the bed of rice bran is used to remove the fishy smell. Another name for this dish is \"osasajinni,\" which is said to be the name for the nuka-miso that was used by the ladies of the palace at Kokura Castle in the old days. Because of its high nutritional value and preservation, it was also used during wars, and was named \"jindani\" by Lord Ogasawara, the feudal lord of the Ogura domain at that time. Since the mid-Edo period, sugar and sake have been added to the dish, leading to today's \"nuka-miso takikaki\" food culture.

Today, oden is popular as a winter side dish because of its simplicity and the presence of fish paste, daikon radish, kelp, etc., and oden with distinctive ingredients are spreading in different regions. In Tokyo, oden is characterized by the inclusion of chikuwabu.",

    "history": "Ibaraki Prefecture's lotus root ranks first in Japan in terms of both the volume of its shipments and the area where it is planted, boasting a share of over 50% of the domestic market. Areas around Kasumigaura are blessed with abundant water and fertile wetlands, so the cultivation of lotus root is thriving. The period in which lotus root is harvested in Kasumigaura is from July to March. At this time of year, all lotus stems and leaves are cut down to stop them from growing, and by doing this, the lotus roots, which lie underground, slowly accumulate starch. The longer they stay in the mud, the more starch they gain, which gives summer lotus root a crispy texture, and winter lotus root a fluffy, delicate flavor.Since adzuki beans also come from Ibaraki Prefecture, 'ogura renkon' has long been made at home, as it can be made with locally available ingredients. Other regions also have a local dish called 'adzuki renkon' or 'renkon adzuki stew,' but the key to Ibaraki's version is that it is stewed with adzuki beans to give it a 'shiho-iro' color. 'Shiho' is another name for Mt. Tsukuba, a famous mountain in Ibaraki Prefecture, which came to be called Shiho (purple peak) because the surface of the mountain turns red in the morning and evening sunlight.",

It is a hearty stew featuring ingredients such as chicken, satoimo, renkon, nagaimo (Chinese yam), shiitake mushrooms, gobo (burdock root), and koya-dofu (freeze-dried tofu), and served with plenty of broth. It is a dish often served during large gatherings, such as ceremonial occasions like weddings and funerals―and in such instances, the Ohira bowl can have a diameter as large as 50 cm.Traditionally, the contents of the Ohira are served up in small plates to individual diners. Since it is a lightly flavored, soup-based dish, it is common to consume both the ingredients and the broth together. Together with the luxurious and decorative “Iwakuni Sushi,” Ohira is considered an essential culinary element in celebratory events.",

In Yamagata Prefecture, the culture of eating this flower is still strong, and “Ohitashi of edible chrysanthemums” (boiled and eaten with soy sauce) is a typical example. Among the edible chrysanthemums grown in Yamagata Prefecture, the purple-colored \"Mottenohoka\", which is a late variety, is the most fragrant and delicious of all. “Mottenohoka” means “outrageous” or “out of the question” in Japanese. Its official name is \"Enmeiraku\", but it is said to be called that because \"eating it is out of the question as chrysanthemum is the crest of the emperor's family” or \"just too delicious\". The deliciousness of \"Mottenohoka\" lies in its unique crunchy texture. This is largely due to the shape of the individual petals of the chrysanthemum, which are tubular rather than sheet-shaped. Various varieties of edible chrysanthemums are cultivated in Yamagata Prefecture, and they are eaten as “ohitashi” (boiled), “sunomono” (pickled), or as tempura.",

While topping it with a rich, sweet sauce is universal, mayonnaise is also often added if you like. A spatula is used as the eating utensil when okonomiyaki is eaten from the steel plate griddle it’s cooked on. Okonomiyaki is called “the soul food of Hiroshima,” and the prefecture ranked first in the country for the number of okonomiyaki shops per population of 100,000 people (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; 2014 Economic Census - Basic Research). Okonomiyaki originates from a dish eaten in the period prior to the Second World War known as “issen yoshoku” (lit. one cent western meal), and in its use as a food to stave off hunger, transformed into okonomiyaki in the post-war era. In those days there were many steel factories in Hiroshima, meaning steel plate griddles were relatively easy to obtain, which is why it’s believed the number of okonomiyaki shops increased. In the year Showa 30 (1955), an increased number of stores remodeled their buildings and became able to offer soba noodles and pork, progressing the popularization of okonomiyaki. After that, following the championship victory of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team in Showa 50 (1975) Hiroshima was put on the map, being featured in things like guidebooks and okonomiyaki became known throughout the country.",

Yamagata seisai are large vegetables, weighing around 500g each with a length of 70 to 80cm. In \"seisaizuke,\" the thick stems are highly valued, so the leaf tips were often thrown away. The traders from Omi province started to cut off the tips and pickle them, which led to the name \"omizuke.\" (There are many other origin theories for the name, such as that the cut vegetables were rubbed (momi) and pickled, leading to the name \"momizuke,\" which eventually became “omizuke\").In this way, \"omizuke\" is said to have developed as a clever way to use up leftover vegetables, so not only \"Yamagata seisai\" but any leftover vegetables can be chopped and pickled to make this dish.",

This was the target of Kumano's traditional whaling. Wada Yorimoto started organized whaling in 1606 and is regarded as the founder of whaling.In 1675, Yoriharu, Yorimoto's grandson, invented the netting method, which enabled him to catch humpback whales that would sink after death, in addition to right whales and sperm whales that would stay afloat after death. Because this method required the use of many seko-vessels and ami-vessels, it developed into a large-scale fishery involving more than 300 men. Eventually, the netting and poking method was introduced to Tosa and Kyushu, and the lords protected and encouraged whaling, which led to whaling in many parts of Japan.Even after the end of the Edo period and major changes in society, whaling continued to be practiced in Taiji. However, in December 1878, the Taiji whaling team was swept out to sea in pursuit of right whales with calves, and although they succeeded in capturing one on the second morning, it took a long time to return, and in the afternoon the weather broke and the fleet drifted away, with over 100 people missing. The accident, later called \"Seminaregawa,\" put an end to the old-style whaling in Taiji, and modern whaling methods developed in the U.S. and Norway were soon introduced. Whaling continues in Taiji to this day, albeit in a different form.The people of Kumano have consumed whale meat and entrails, as well as bones and skin, without wasting anything. The most expensive meat is the \"tail meat,\" a rare part of the whale, and its marbled meat is tender and sweet.",

It is a dish that is especially popular in the Shinkawa area, such as Uozu City and Kurobe City, where the mountainous area facing Toyama Bay has a large elevation difference with mountains as tall as 2,000m. Grilled mackerel flakes are seasoned with sweet vinegar, sandwiched between vinegared rice, topped with nori, pressed down with a heavy stone, and left overnight. One of its characteristics is that it is cut into squares. It is said that in the olden days, “osezushi ”started off as fish sandwiched between rice and was called “fish rice.” People began to use vinegared rice and thus, it transformed to its present form. Mackerel is commonly used, but some households use horse mackerel, deep sea smelt, salmon, and other seasonal fish.",

    "history": "“Oshibori Udon” is a local dish that originated from the Sakaki area in Hanishina County. It is made by grating spicy daikon radish and squeezing out its juice. “Oshibori udon” is characterized by the use of squeezed daikon juice instead of dashi broth. The word “oshibori” in oshibori udon refers to this unique feature. This dish became popular during the Edo period (1603-1868) to the Meiji period (1868-1912). It gained fame because of the excellent combination of spicy daikon squeezed soup and Shinshu miso (rice miso). The locals used miso as a dipping sauce for udon and soba noodles. The radish used for oshibori udon is “Nezumi daikon,” a specialty of Sakaki Town. Although the daikon is surprisingly spicy, the squeezed soup is served with mild Shinshu miso dissolved in it. The deep taste of the spiciness is followed by a hint of sweetness, which makes you sweat when you eat it. It warms the body from the core, and the local people describe the taste as “amamokura”. Togakushi and Chikuma City (formerly Koshoku City and Tokura Town) in the prefecture also have oshiborisoba, which is cold soba noodles dipped in a dipping sauce made from squeezed juice of spicy daikon radish and miso.",

During the off-season before wheat harvesting and rice planting, Sanuki farmers have a custom called \"harui-oi,\" in which they buy a Spanish mackerel and prepare various Spanish mackerel dishes, inviting their relatives to join in the festivities. The main dish of this \"Haru-i-o\" is \"oshi-nuki zushi\" (pressed sushi without the fish), which is made of Spanish mackerel. In families with young brides, the mother-in-law buys Spanish mackerel and sends the daughter-in-law back to her hometown with a fish box covered with nanten (a kind of bamboo shoot). The bride would then take the \"oshinuki zushi\" made at her parents' home back home as a souvenir to her wedding home, thus bringing the two families closer together. The custom of \"oshinuki zushi\" of Spanish mackerel \"spring celebration fish\" is still practiced in some areas under the names of \"mugi-urashi\" and \"hatsuho (first ears of Spanish mackerel)\".",

Because it can be easily combined with any ingredients, a variety of tofu dishes are served in local households, but the two most popular are \"chilled tofu\" and \"yudofu,\" which allow the flavors of the ingredients to be enjoyed as they are.Because Mt.

Since it was possible to make a round trip from Edo (Tokyo) in three to four days without passing through a barrier, many commoners visited the mountain during the Edo period to pray for rain and prosperous business. When the population of Edo was 1 million, as many as 200,000 people visited Oyama in a single summer.Daisen's tofu was first made using soybeans donated from various places and local fresh water. There is an anecdote that in the old days, visitors to Mt. Oyama during the height of the hot summer would slurp tofu in the palm of their hands as they walked around the mountain. Tofu dishes were also served to worshippers at nearby inns, where they were greatly appreciated and eventually became a local specialty.In 2016, the Agency for Cultural Affairs recognized the \" Oyama Pilgrimage\" as a Japanese Heritage Site, and tofu cuisine is one of the components of the Japan Heritage Site.",

Tofu is typically used, but in the past every household grew their own vegetables, and so those vegetables were often used. Thus, instead of using tofu, which was not always available, taro was often used instead because it was available in every household.

Using cooled noodles thinner than hōtō, ozara is a dish where you enjoy these noodles by dipping them into a warm soy sauce based dipping sauce. As opposed to hōtō which you directly cook in a pot with other ingredients and enjoy, the noodles for ozara are rinsed in cold water after they are boiled on their own. This allows the noodles to be slippery and refreshing to slurp, making them an easy food to eat during the hot summers and a popular choice to prevent fatigue from the summer heat.

During the Muromachi period, in Kyoto, the aristocracy served a miso-based ozoni with round mochi as a hospitality dish, while upper-class samurai enjoyed it as a celebratory meal. This dish was not limited to New Year's celebrations. The tradition of eating ozoni during New Year's festivities, regardless of social status, is said to have started during the Edo period. Through cultural exchange events like \"Sankin Kotai\" (alternate attendance) system, the tradition of ozoni spread across various regions in Japan. Initially, even Edo (current Tokyo) had miso-based ozoni, but during the Genroku era, soy sauce production flourished in Noda and Choshi in Shimousa, leading to the establishment of a darker soy sauce-based ozoni, which is preferred by Edokko (people from Edo). Thus, Edo-style ozoni adopted the clear broth made with kombu and katsuobushi, along with soy sauce.While ozoni commonly features mochi, there's a regional difference: Western Japan typically uses round mochi, while Eastern Japan uses square or rectangular mochi. The origin of square mochi is linked to the samurai's interpretation of cutting it as a metaphor for conquering enemies. Eventually, the practicality of slicing the flattened mochi into smaller pieces led to the establishment of square mochi in Eastern Japan.On New Year's Day, ozoni is prepared by drawing the first water of the year (wakamizu) and using purified fire to cook the soup, creating a series of actions symbolizing vitality and consumption of auspicious food. Edo-style ozoni is characterized by pouring clear broth made from kombu and katsuobushi over grilled mochi, creating a delightful aroma. The specific ingredients might vary by region, with komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach) and naruto (fish cake with pink swirl) being used.",

In the old days, it was customary to harvest the Unzen persimmons and prepare persimmon pickles after the rice cultivation work was completed in the fall.The secret to its deliciousness is to make it with a large quantity of persimmons, as many as radish.

From that distinctive flavor and experience he refined the dish, which in later years would become a noodle dish renown throughout the country alongside “chanpon”.“The original plate udon” passed down uses the same thick noodles as chanpon and is essentially a chanpon stir fry. It is almost a completely different dish from the plate udon made in more recent years which uses thin, crunchy noodles and has the mix of ingredients covered in a thick sauce. The residents of Nagasaki explicitly differentiate these two, the former being referred to as “thick plate udon” and the latter as “thin plate udon.”Furthermore, the name “plate udon” comes from the fact that at the time of its inception, it was standard practice to serve noodles in a wooden or porcelain bowl or other deep vessel. The dish appearing on a plate aroused much surprise, and the name is said to stem from there.",

It has a strong sweet and spicy flavor, and since moisture has evaporated, it can be stored for a long time, making it a handy preserved food.Lake Ashi is a caldera lake with an altitude of 724 meters, created by the volcanic activity of the Hakone volcano. Known as a scenic spot to view Mt. Fuji upside down, it has also prospered in the fishing industry since ancient times. In 1918, pond smelt eggs were transplanted from Lake Kasumigaura in Ibaraki Prefecture, and pond smelt fishing began. Since then, they have continued to be bred for more than 100 years. The smelt raised in the clear water of Lake Ashi has a reputation for its deliciousness and is popular not only with locals but also with tourists as a specialty product of Hakone.On October 1st of every year, the ban on net fishing for smelt is lifted at Lake Ashi. On this day local fishermen set sail all at once, and the first catch of the day is presented to the Imperial Household Agency after praying at Hakone Shrine.Pond smelt can be cooked in a variety of ways, such as fried or marinated in nanban, but in particular, kanroni is a dish that has been popular in this region for a long time and is a standard dish on New Year's dinner tables.",

Pumpkin itoko-ni, which is boiled with adzuki beans, has become a staple dish for the winter solstice.Itoko-ni refers to a stew made mainly from vegetables and beans. It is said that this dish originated from boiling and eating the vegetables and beans that were offered at New Year's, Obon, and other celebrations after the event. There are various theories about the origin of the name, one of which is that since each type of vegetable is boiled separately and the Japanese term for this, “meimei,” is also the pronunciation for the word “nieces,” fellow nieces would be cousins, the word for which is “itoko” in Japanese. Also, there is a theory that because the vegetables are cooked “oioi” - that is, one after another - and this is also the pronunciation for “nephews” in Japanese, fellow nephews would be cousins. Another theory is that vegetables and beans come from fields and are like cousins.Because pumpkins can be stored for a long time, they were a valuable source of nutrition during times when food was scarce. There are various theories as to why we eat pumpkins on the winter solstice, but it is said that the custom of eating highly nutritious pumpkins that have been preserved in hopes that one will be able to healthily survive the cold season when the harvest of vegetables is scarce has been handed down until today. In addition, red beans can be stored for a long time and are highly nutritious, so pumpkin itoko-ni is popular as a local dish to survive the winter without catching a cold. Furthermore, it is thought that people started eating pumpkin itoko-ni made with red beans and pumpkins, to bring in good luck as the red color of red beans is said to ward off evil spirits.",

In particular, unskinned boneless ribs (boneless ribs) are often used. Also, during periods of poverty, lard was a valuable source of nutrients. The reason pork is often used is that pork culture developed under the influence of interchange with China during the Ryukyuan dynastic period. The Japanese taboo against eating meat was introduced but did not take root there. Thus, pork has been used even following Buddhist memorial services. Particularly famous among such Okinawan pork dishes is rafute (Okinawan-style stewed pork cubes). Rafute is a stew of unskinned cubed boneless pork ribs. It is stewed patiently with sugar, soy sauce, and awamori (an Okinawan liquor). A feature of rafute is the soft, melt-in-your-mouth feel of the rind, and one can enjoy the faintly lingering scent of the awamori (Okinawan liquor). Originally, rafute had a strong flavor because it was a preserved food of warm Okinawa. But its flavor generally weakened with the times, and it has come to represent Ryukyuan cuisine and is offered as a dish to entertain guests and following Buddhist memorial services. Rafute is also known as \"Rafuti.\"",

Peanuts are rich in nutrients such as fat and protein, and they were a valuable preserved food in the days when food was more scarce, thus becoming a regional cuisine. Even today, when raw peanuts are available, quite a few households make their own \"Rakkasei-miso\" with seasonings of their choice to always have on hand as a side dish. It is a familiar dish that is also served in school lunches and sold at supermarkets.\"Bocchi,\" a pile of harvested peanuts left to air dry naturally, has become a symbol of autumn.",

Since then, the number of ramen stores in Hokkaido has increased, and each store has evolved in its own way as they compete with each other for flavor.Hokkaido's \"ramen\" is often based on thick, oily pork bone broth, which is believed to have been inherited from the cloudy pork bone broth eaten by the Ainu people in the past. As for noodles, many restaurants use noodles made at noodle mills rather than homemade noodles. The relationship between the noodle stores and the noodle makers is therefore deep, and there is a unique custom in which the noodle store that makes the noodles used by the store is presented with the curtain of the noodle shop.",

As a result, the cultivation of lotus root spread rapidly as an alternative to rice cultivation, and the city is still known as one of the leading lotus root production areas in the country. When it was first cultivated, \"Bicchu\" was the most suitable variety of lotus root for simmered dishes due to its firm texture, but today, various varieties are grown, including \"Lotus White\" with a strong crunchy texture and \"Kanasumi\" with a strong firm texture.Because of this, lotus root dishes are often eaten mainly in the Owari area, including Aisai City.

It widely swept across the coast, ravaging entire farmlands and causing famine. The people in the area survived hunger mainly by eating sweet potatoes, which can grow even in barren land. The origin of the dish is that a man named Rokubei of Fukae Village (present-day Fukae Town, Minamishimabara City) devised an udon-like dish by mixing the powder of preserved sweet potatoes with yams, which act as a binder. This delighted many people. This is said to be the beginning of “rokubei” in Shimabara.In Tsushima the main ingredient for rokubei is sen, a preserved food made by fermenting sweet potatoes. The sweet potato is called kokoimo (filial piety) because it saved the islanders from starvation.",

They would then cut them into thin slices and eat them while still frozen. It was also effective against parasites, as those such as anisakis would sit inside the salmon’s skin and would be killed by the freezing.

For instance, the mackerel highway to the west led to Tamba Sasayama, where the salted mackerel would reach its optimal saltiness level by the time it arrived.

It is a type of koji food that has been popular since the Edo period (1603-1868), and has long been loved for its health benefits and ability to use up all of the vegetables.It is said that the name comes from the ratio of three parts salt, five parts koji, and eight parts rice, but some say that the actual ratio was 01時01分:1. Because it can be preserved well, it was valued as a side dish during the busy rice-planting season. In recent years, an increasing number of people enjoy pickling not only vegetables, but also meat and seafood.",

Udon production is the second largest in Japan (according to the \"Annual Report on Statistical Survey on Production of Rice and Wheat Processed Foods\" by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2009), and although it has been decreasing compared to the past, it is still a major wheat-producing prefecture. In the past, wheat was widely grown in Saitama Prefecture as a back crop to rice. As a result, wheat has become a central part of the diet, and each region has developed a rich variety of foods using wheat. For example, in the northeastern part of the prefecture, udon noodles are handmade and have a strong and smooth texture; in the western part, udon noodles are served with dipping sauce and have a very strong texture and a brownish color; and in the central part of the prefecture, udon noodles are served along the riverside and are wide and chewy. The number of local dishes and \"B-rank gourmet\" foods that have taken root in the area since ancient times is said to number more than 20 in total. Today, in order to differentiate udon from other regions and express uniqueness, regional names and words that express characteristics are often added, but in the past, udon was almost always called \"udon\" in all regions.",

One of these salmon dishes is “salmon yakizuke” . As the name suggests, it is a simple dish in which grilled salmon is marinated in soy sauce mixed with sake and mirin and served as is or broiled. Originally, it was made in the Edo period as a preserved food when refrigeration technology was not yet developed. It is thought that additional effort was put into preparing this dish because the salmon was a little lacking in fat when grilled and eaten as it was. You can enjoy a completely different flavor from salted salmon and simmered salmon. It does not harden even when cooled and stays fluffy.The history of Murakami's salmon culture goes back to the Heian period, when it is said that salmon was paid to the imperial court in Kyoto as tax. It also has a history of succeeding in artificial proliferation for the first time in the world, and thanks to that, it has become a prosperous city. Therefore, as an expression of gratitude to the salmon, there is a custom of not cutting all of the salmon's belly but leaving a part of it, saying, “We must not let the salmon, which is a blessing from heaven, commit seppuku.”",

The name ‘nare-zushi’ came from the Japanese word ‘nareru’, means ‘’get used to’ or ‘ripen’ because the ingredients get ‘nareru’ as they are fermented. ‘Narezushi’ originally used to be one of the methods to preserve fish longer, and rice, working as fermentation accelerator, was discarded. However, rice was eaten with fish together after shortening fermentation in Muromachi Era. (AD1336~1537)The recipe for ‘Sanma zushi’ in Totsukawa Village varies in north part and south part of the village. In north area, rinse sanma (=pacific saury) after pickled it with salt, then place it onto a bucket with rice cooked with salt and sake. After that, add water and salt and ferment for a long time. In south region, on the other hand, pickle salted sanma with vinegar, then put vinegar rice on top and press them together. Although the recipes are different, people from both areas use sanma with less fatty caught in Kumano Nada from late autumn to early summer. Sanma caught in Kumano Nada is a bit smaller and less fatty, and good for preservative food like ‘Sanma zushi’.",

Today, many ramen stores and Chinese restaurants in the prefecture feature \"Sanma-men\" as their main dish. For the citizens of Yokohama and Kanagawa Prefecture, Sanma-men has become a familiar dish that they see on a daily basis.",

According to one old theory, at the end of the rice harvest, at “the Ebisu-ko Festival ”(which began in the early Showa era), two or three salted sauries (dried) that a trader came from Niigata to sell and one sho of new rice were cooked, and this became the “sanmameshi” that we know today. Even today, many households continue to make this recipe as it is a method of simply lining up the saury and cooking it with rice, resulting in a delicious meal even on busy days.",

Although “Sanmazushi” is usually served with the backbones removed, in the version prepared for this ritual, the bones are left intact, as it is endowed with the hopes that the children will grow up strong in body and mind, and perhaps to supplement their calcium intake as well. At the front of the torii gate at Ubuta Shrine is a sign written on a log, indicating that this is the birthplace of “Sanmazushi.”This is a local dish traditionally served at celebratory and festive occasions, and was first promoted by restaurants in Owase in 1975 in a bid to establish it as a famous specialty of the area. Ever since, it has now become one of the most popular culinary highlights in the Eastern Kishu region. Moreover, in this area, it is common to prepare and serve “sugatazushi (a type of sushi in which the entire body of the fish, from head to toe, is used)” during many celebratory events. And so, when sanma (Pacific Saury) is not in season, other fish, such as sardine, horse mackerel, and barracuda, are also used.",

    "history": "Sansho (=Japanese Pepper) is a kind of spices and used in various Japanese cuisines as seasoning. It is said that Sansho was delivered from China in Heian Era (AD794-AD1192) and it was written in many historical records like ‘Gishi Wajinden’ or ‘Kojiki’. Currently Asakura Sansho is dominant in the market, and Arima Sansho can rarely be seen. Sansho is typically cooked as ‘Tsukudani’, simmered with soy sauce, sake and ‘Mirin’ (=sweet rice wine).Asakura Sansho is grown in Yabu City Youka-cho Asakura area. The tree doesn’t have thorns and bears bigger fruits with great fragrance. Its name came from the area grown and the name of powerful regional families in the area. People offered ‘sansho’ to the ‘Bakufu’ (samurai government) in Edo Period. (AD1603-AD1868) Many locals cooked ‘Sansho no Tsukudani’ with Asakura Sansho at home until around 1965, but many manufacturers have started selling one as the demand of spices has increased since around 1975. The dish won the best award at ‘Local specialty recommended by the municipality government’ section of the ‘Local Specialty of the Year’, competition supported by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, in 2017.Arima Sansho is grown in Arima area. Unlike Asakura Sansho, its brunches have sharp thorns. Its fruits have great fragrance and strong spicy flavor. There are many Japanese dishes named with ‘Arima’ using Arima Sansho, but actually Asakura Sansho is used in most of dishes. Local homes in Arima area kept food culture eating Arima Sansho until around 1965, but now it’s in danger of extinction. It can be because the locals who knew where Arima Sansho trees were didn’t tell anyone where to find ones, so no one could promote about the Sansho to outside of the area. In 2009, however, the project to revive the tradition of Arima Sansho was launched to walk in the Arima area to find wild Sansho trees. Local farmers started to grow Sansho in 2013, and the movement to prevail Arima Sansho is getting active.",

It is said that \"Kenshin Uesugi used it as a portable food\" because it was considered a portable preserved food in the Warring States period, as bamboo leaves have a sterilizing effect. It is also said that it was used as a portable food by Uesugi Kenshin. There are also various theories that it was born out of the wisdom of eating rice scraps that did not become tribute rice.It was recommended as a souvenir at the Niigata National Athletic Meet held in 1964 and became famous for its resemblance to a rice bale, reminding people of Niigata as a rice-producing region. The rice-bag-like shape reminded people of Niigata as a rice-producing region. Today, it is eaten as a wagashi (Japanese confectionery) wrapped in red bean paste, but in the past, it is said to have served as a staple food with home-style side dishes such as kinpira and okaka (dried bonito flakes). On Hare no Hi, top rice was used and azuki beans were added. In some regions, dumplings with red bean paste are called \"onna-dango\", those with other ingredients than red bean paste are called \"aemon-dango\", and those with kinpira or without any ingredients are called \"otoko-dango\".",

In those days, when transportation was not as developed as it is today, \"Grilled Kamaboko\" emerged as a method for preservation. Until then, each household would mince white fish into a paste, shape it with their palm, then grill it on a bamboo skewer, and this eventually entered the market as a food product. At the time it was referred to as \"Tenohira (Palm) Kamaboko\" or \"Bero (Tongue) Kamaboko,\" but it later came to be called \"Sasa (Bamboo) Kamaboko\" in connection to the \"Take ni Suzume (Bamboo and Sparrow)\" Date clan family crest of the former Sendai domain, and it was unified into \"Sasa Kamaboko\" at the start of the Showa period.Since then, there has been a dramatic drop in the catch of flounder and other fish, so other white-fleshed fish such as walleye pollock are used today instead. Now, they are mainly processed into fish paste and flash frozen while still fresh on the fishing boat. It is gaining popularity as a health food due to its light flavor, high-quality protein, and low calorie count. Thanks to advances in packaging technology and transportation speed in recent years, Sasa Kamaboko is widely beloved as a local specialty and souvenir representing Miyagi prefecture. There are over 40 manufacturers of various sizes in Miyagi prefecture, each offering many products featuring their own unique concepts. In addition to eating it plain, it is also eaten in arranged dishes such as kakiage, oden stew, and tempura.",

While a similar dish in Ishikawa Prefecture called \"Oshizushi\" is made by pressing down on vinegared rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, Niigata's \"Sasazushi\" is made by placing vinegared rice on kuma bamboo leaves and arranging various ingredients and seasonings on top. In some areas of the Joetsu region, including cities like Myoko, Joetsu, and Itoigawa, bamboo leaves are folded in the shape of a winnowing basket to create a variation known as \"Mizushi.” Some areas even use special wooden boxes for layering.Traditionally, “Sasazushi” was prepared for special occasions, such as festival days or the Bon Festival when many people would gather. The styles of “Sasazushi” differ slightly between regions and households, with some variations adorning the sushi rice with colorful ingredients while others mix the ingredients with the rice. Making “Sasazushi” at home has become less common over the years since it can be a hassle to make.There are several theories about the origin of \"Sasazushi\" and how it came to both Niigata and Nagano Prefectures. One theory suggests that Uesugi Kenshin’s forces used bamboo leaves to serve rice in place of bowls in the mountains while battling Takeda Shingen during the Warring States period. Another theory suggests that residents of the Tomikura region in Iiyama, Nagano Prefecture, offered sushi wrapped in bamboo leaves to Uesugi Kenshin as he departed for the Battles of Kawanakajima. Furthermore, bamboo leaves have strong preservative properties, allowing its contents to be stored and consumed at a later time. It's said that Uesugi Kenshin himself actually carried rice wrapped in bamboo leaves while traveling.Tanabata is also known as the Bamboo Festival. In 2014, the Junior Chamber International Itoigawa submitted an application to the Japan Anniversary Association to designate July 7th as \"Itoigawa Tanabata Sasazushi Day.\" This application was successfully approved and “Itoigawa Tanabata Sasazushi Day” is now an official commemorative day. The hope for this initiative is that people would rediscover the charm of Itoigawa by experiencing traditional local cuisine on Tanabata.",

While “sake-zushi” is a sumptuous dish made with ingredients from both the sea and the mountains which was mainly eaten by feudal lords and high-ranking warriors, “satsuma sumoji” is made using seasonal ingredients that could be found close at hand.

Although it is a type of “chirashi-zushi” or “bara-zushi”, one of the characteristics of Kagoshima Prefecture’s “satsuma sumoji” is its use of local sake. This local sake is called “kurozake” or “akumochizake”. It is made by adding lye to the mash and squeezing it out during the brewing process. In Kagoshima Prefecture, it is used in place of mirin and also drunk as “otoso” New Year’s sake. The production of this local sake flourished because, in the past, Kagoshima Prefecture’s warm climate was unsuitable for the production of ordinary sake. Because it is made without being heated, it is rich in amino acids, organic acids, and minerals, none of which are destroyed during the brewing process. It is also said to bring out the flavor of food. “Sake-zushi” is fermented using this local sake, while “satsuma sumoji” is made by dipping your hands in the local sake and vigorously using them to mix the ingredients and the rice.",

Various kinds of food are served up: seasonal raw fish dishes such as sashimi or skipjack tuna tataki; varieties of sushi including sugata zushi and inaka zushi (vegetable sushi); platters known as kumimono where sushi is served alongside stewed items, foods dressed with various sauces, deep-fried food, or sweets and fruits. There are also platters serving items such as steamed bream, somen noodles, and zenzai (a soup made from azuki beans).In Kochi, inviting guests over for a feast is known as \"okyaku\"; even today, okyaku culture is deeply rooted. Sawachi ryori arose as a way of serving food during these okyaku. It was created as a way to serve about three servings of food on one dish. The food is replenished as it is eaten. You can recognise the scale of an okyaku party by the number of platters served.The origins of sawachi ryori date back to the Edo period, when food would be served on great platters at the end of samurai banquets. Eventually, it spread further after the Meiji period, as okyaku cuisine. It was also a symbol of one's social status: wealthy families would gather expensive Imari, Kutani and Arita ware dishes, and store accessories in their storehouses such as sake cup stands and lacquerware stands to place their platters on.",

The dish is prepared by placing thinly sliced Spanish mackerel slices on kombu, wrapping them in kombu, and letting them rest for about half a day.It is said that \"kombu-jime of Spanish mackerel\" originated as a way to utilize kombu brought by the Kitamae-bune, a group of merchant ships that traveled between Hokkaido and Osaka. A similar traditional food has taken root in Toyama Prefecture, which was once a territory of the Kaga Domain, and is called \"susu\" instead of Spanish mackerel.On the other hand, kombu-jime, which is made from Spanish mackerel, is also available. This is often served as an event food.",

From the middle of the Meiji era, Sawara no Kōko Sushi started being made with Spanish mackerel to celebrate a bountiful catch and to pray for the safety of fishermen. It is made by mixing rice seasoned with the vinegar used to cure the Spanish mackerel with thinly sliced pickled daikon radish and green peas, and topped with cured Spanish mackerel and prickly ash leaves. At first, it was eaten only with Spanish mackerel and no other ingredients, but eventually the well-pickled daikon radishes that were added on the side of the plate in the autumn became incorporated into the sushi rice. It was said to be so delicious that pickled daikon radishes were incorporated into the dish from then on.",

The local authorities promote the region as the \"Kingdom of Shellfish in the Oki Islands,\" highlighting the charm of local ingredients.Sazae (turban shell) is still harvested using traditional fishing methods. One such method is \"Kanagi-gyo,\" where fishermen use a glass-fitted wooden box called \"Hakomegane\" to peer into the seabed from the fishing boat and use a spear-like tool to catch Sazae. Additionally, fishermen engage in \"Sashiami-gyo,\" a method where they dive and use a net to catch shellfish on the seabed. While Sazae was once freely harvested, recent regulations on fishing rights have led to increased prices.Oki's Sazae is a staple in Oki Island's cuisine, offering a delightful crunchy texture when eaten as sashimi, and a gentle essence permeates when grilled or simmered, adding depth to the flavor. Sazae is an essential ingredient on the Oki Islands' dining tables, cherished in various culinary preparations, with \"Sazae Meshi\" being one of the popular Sazae dishes.",

Since turban shells live on reefs and rocky areas, it’s difficult for sand to enter the shell.

As a working mother herself, she wanted to give her children something they would enjoy to eat, even though it was time-consuming to cook azuki red rice, so she established a simple method of cooking rice, mixing it with ama-natto, and adding color with food coloring.Dr. Nambu, who is also a leading expert on Hokkaido's local cuisine, gave lectures throughout the prefecture.

The starting ingredient is \"Miyashige daikon\", also known as \"aokubi daikon\". Around 1897, they were transplanted from Aichi Prefecture to Miyazaki Prefecture; the julienning techniques were conveyed at the same time. Miyazaki Prefecture’s primary production area is Kunitomo Town, and continues to Tano Town and Kiyotake Town. The amount produced depends on whether it is an abundant or bad harvest, but from 2500 tons to 3,000 tons per year.Every year from late November to February, Kunitomi Town’s fields are lined with racks to dry \"sengiri daikon\"; that sight is also a seasonal marker of winter. Farmers wash their harvested daikon and julienne it, immediately spreading it out onto racks, exposing it to the cold west wind blowing from Kirishima. Pure white daikon transforms into shrunken light brown \"sengiri daikon\" in half a day to a day from the Kirishima mountain winds and the strong sunlight characteristic of the south of Japan.",

    "history": "Senmaizuke\" is a pickle made by pickling thinly sliced Shogoin turnips in salt. It is one of the three most popular pickles in Kyoto, along with \"sukkizuke\" and \"shibazuke\". Unlike conventional pickles, it is not intended to be preserved for a long period of time and is delicately pickled.It is said to have been invented by Ohfuji Tozaburo, a chef at the Imperial Palace during the Edo period (1603-1868). Later, Ohfuji Tozaburo became a pickles merchant and sold \"Senmai-zuke\" (pickled sliced radish), which quickly became popular. The product quickly became popular and was even selected as one of the national specialties at the National Exposition held in Kyoto in 1890.The turnip used is the traditional Kyoto vegetable \"Shogoin turnip. It is said that this turnip originated in the Kyoho period when a farmer in Shogoin, Sakyo-ku brought back seeds of Omi turnips that had been cultivated in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and started growing them. It is the largest turnip in Japan, weighing from 4 to 5 kg in large pieces, and has a soft and elegant flavor. As \"senmaizuke\" became popular, its cultivation flourished. In Shino-machi, Kameoka City, where Shogoin turnips are famous, production began soon after World War II. Most of the \"senmaizuke\" produced in Kyoto comes from this area. It has been certified as a \"traditional vegetable of Kyoto\" as it has been eaten in Kyoto since ancient times.Kyoto Prefecture designates traditional foods made with traditional ingredients and techniques as \"traditional Kyoto foods\" and Senmaizuke is one of them.",

As its name suggests, the eggplant has so much moisture that water drips down when squeezed tightly, and it is characterized by its freshness with a hint of sweetness. It can be eaten raw as it has little acridity, but it is most often eaten as a pickle in a bed of salted rice bran or in a seasoning solution. The most popular type of pickled eggplant is asazuke, in which the freshness of the eggplant can be enjoyed.The Senshu area is blessed with moderate temperature and humidity near the sea, making it ideal for growing mizu-nasu, and it is said that mizu-nasu will not grow as well as mizu-asu grown in other areas. Mizunasu has been cultivated in the Senshu area since the early Edo period. Because of its thin skin, it is not suitable for transportation, and when made into pickles, the skin turns a dull brown color. Subsequently, the variety was improved, and a variety with a brightly colored skin appeared, making Senshu mizu nasu asazuke (pickled eggplant) widely known throughout the country.",

This region has a mild climate, plenty of water, and fertile soil, making it suitable for growing \"Miike Takana\". This vegetable is still grown in the region today. The name \"takana\" means tall leaf in Japanese because this vegetable grows to be at least one meter in height. \"Takana\" is rich in vitamins, carotene, iron, and calcium. “Setaka no Takana Zuke” is nutritious and can be preserved for a long time and is a popular food enjoyed by the people of Japan.

Shibazuke\" is one of Kyoto's representative pickles, and along with \"sukkizuke\" and \"senmaizuke,\" is regarded as one of the three most popular pickles in Kyoto. Shibazuke is made by pickling eggplant, cucumber, myoga, etc. in salt with shiso leaves. It is characterized by its bright purple color and sour taste.The Ohara area in Sakyo-ku, Kyoto City is known as a production center of \"aka shiso\" (red perilla). It is highly valued for its color and aroma, and is in high demand both within and outside of the prefecture. The Ohara area's red shiso is considered the closest to the original variety because it has been cultivated more than 800 times and because the area's location in a basin prevents pollen from flying in from outside the region.Shibazuke is said to have been invented by Seio Daishi, a monk at the famous Sanzen-in Temple in Ohara. The name is said to have originated with Kenreimonin, the empress of Emperor Takakura. When local residents presented Kenreimonin, who resided quietly at Jakkoin Temple in Ohara, with a pickle made from shiso, she was delighted with its taste. The local people were so pleased with the taste that they named the dish \"Murasaki haazuke\" (purple leaf pickles) after the bright purple color. Because of this, \"shibazuke\" has become a staple in Ohara area households.",

Setashijimi inhabits the shallow waters of Lake Biwa to a depth of less than 10m, but due to environmental deterioration such as the reduction of sandy soil, it is said that the habitat of the clams is changing. Until around 1965, setashijimi inhabited Lake Biwa in large numbers, and shijimi-jiru, shigure-ni, and shijimi-meshi were eaten on a daily basis. However, due to changes in the environment, the yield has decreased rapidly. The freshwater clams become plump and delicious when they come fully into season in April starting from December, so they are also called “kanshijimi (cold clams).” Local fishermen say that they are particularly delicious in the spring, when the spawning season is approaching.",

Kairakuen was created by Nariaki Tokugawa, the ninth head of the Tokugawa family of the Mito domain. There are two reasons why Nariaki planted many plum trees. One reason is that the plum tree, as the flower that heralds the arrival of spring, makes people feel positive about the future. And the sour taste of the plum fruit was the best food for the military, as it quenched thirst and fatigue, which led to the planting of many plum trees.In order to make effective use of all the plums harvested at Kairakuen, Prince Nariaki invented the \"Shikinbai\" plum tree. Clean, undamaged plums are used for umeboshi (pickled plums) and umeshu (plum wine), while damaged or unsightly plums are beaten with a mallet to remove the seeds, and only the flesh is pickled with shiso (a type of perilla). It is also called \"Ume-bishio.In addition to Kairakuen, Ibaraki Prefecture has many other famous ume viewing spots, such as Koudoukan in Mito City and Mount Tsukuba.

The time of Hatsuuma was the peak season for vegetables, and it was difficult to procure foodstuffs. Mishitsuke, made from leftovers, was not originally suitable as an offering to the gods. Therefore, it is thought that the food was sublimated into an offering to the Inari shrine by making it an \"oddity,\" an offering to the gods, instead of being made normally.The ingredients vary from region to region. In the central part of Tochigi Prefecture and the lower reaches of the Kinugawa River in Ibaraki Prefecture, the basic ingredients are radish, soybeans, salted salmon head, sake lees, carrots, and deep-fried tofu. In the eastern part of Saitama Prefecture, northern part of Chiba Prefecture, southern part of Fukushima Prefecture, and Tajima, only radish and soybeans are used, but there are also combinations of radish, soybeans, and salted salmon head, or radish, soybeans, salted salmon head, and sakekasu.

Schools of the fish swim upstream from mid-October to November, laying their eggs on the riverbed. \"Shishamo\" containing roe (eggs) are especially delicious, serving well as either a side dish with rice or a snack to accompany drinks.For the Ainu people indigenous to Hokkaido, fish such as \"shishamo\" or salmon were treasured as a precious foodstuff for getting through the winter. In kanji characters, \"shishamo\" is written as \"willow-leaf fish\": this originates from the story that the fish was created from a willow leaf by the Ainu gods.",

The flavor of the beans and the soy sauce combined well, and the beans tasted delicious.The cultivation of fava beans spread throughout Japan after the Meiji period (1868-1912). Since Kagawa Prefecture is blessed with a mild climate that is ideal for growing fava beans, farmers began to grow fava beans as a side crop to rice, and they have become one of the most popular vegetables in Japan.

Dried strips of daikon radish were exposed to the sun and cold wind for 3days, then frozen by night wind on the last day. The texture is crispy.Natto is well-known product in Mito City.

Natto had offered to Samurai ‘Shogun’ General since then, and both soybeans and straws were easy to obtain for ordinary people, natto has been popular since then.

In Shiiba Village, the traditional dish “somage” refers to buckwheat dumplings prepared in a vegetable soup, seasoned with a broth made from dried sardines. In contrast, Kagoshima prefecture's somage involves boiling sweet potatoes, mashing them while hot, and adding buckwheat flour to create a ball-like shape. In some variations, red bean paste is added inside. In Miyakonojo City, a similar dish is prepared by mixing buckwheat flour into boiled sweet potatoes. This dish is known as sobagai around Shiiba Village and the Kashiwabara area, and was commonly eaten until around wartime. It was prepared by making a paste from sweet potatoes, mixing in buckwheat flour after removing it from heat, and then slicing it for consumption.Buckwheat, an annual plant from the knotweed family, is well-suited to less fertile and cool mountainous areas. It has been cultivated since the 8th century. Once the buckwheat seeds were sown and the grains developed, they were harvested, bundled, thoroughly dried, and then threshed on a straw mat to remove the grains. These grains were then ground into flour using a stone mill. Although buckwheat cultivation was partly a measure to conserve rice, somage is a remarkable buckwheat dish that enhances the subdued flavors of wild and garden vegetables using oil and condiments, resulting in a rich and fresh taste.",

The process involves steaming glutinous rice, dyeing it with gardenia fruit, and then crushing and spreading it thinly into the shape of an oval coin, which is then dried and served as portable food or ration.The dried gardenia fruit was believed to have medicinal properties such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, and diuretic effects, making Someii popular as a food that helped relieve fatigue in the legs and lower back.Someii is an ancient dish that even appeared in the novel \"Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige\" written by Jippensha Ikku, a famous classical writer. However, over time, it became a dish enjoyed only by a limited number of households. About 60 years ago, it was on the verge of being forgotten, but then a bento (boxed lunch) vendor in Fujieda City collaborated with the Chamber of Commerce to revive it. They transformed the dried rice into a modern onigiri (rice ball) that could be quickly consumed.",

    "history": "Oita Prefecture is home to many local sweets made from wheat flour, such as “Yaseuma”, “Jiriyaki” and “Yudemochi” (boiled rice cakes). The reason for this can be found in the flour-based food culture that was rooted in the past. Oita Prefecture has a well-developed plateau and much of its land is unsuitable for rice cultivation. After waterways were built in various areas, the cultivation of wheat in the fields developed. From there, flour came to be used in cooking and became a common ingredient in local sweets and cuisine. “Sorakitamochi” is a local confectionery that has been popular on the remote island of Himeshima, located at the western end of the Seto Inland Sea, for many years. Himeshima is about a 20-minute ferry ride from Imi Port in Kunisaki City. According to “Kuniumi”, one of the myths in the Kojiki (records of ancient matters), Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto created the island of Himeshima, which is said to be this island, Himeshima. The seas around Himeshima, which is in the Suonada Sea, are good fishing grounds for a variety of seafood such as sea bream, octopus, prawn and sea bass. On Himeshima, surrounded by the sea, rice could not be grown on the island, and instead wheat flour and sweet potatoes were often grown there. It is an affordable snack in such an environment. The \"Sorakitamochi\", which is popular in Himeshima Village, is made by mashing soft boiled sweet potatoes, covering half of them with flour and kneading them over a fire to make a skin. The rest of the sweet potatoes were sweetened with sugar to make paste and wrapped in the skin. The cooking time is reduced because no steaming is required. It can be made so quickly so you can say “Sora kita!” (Here you come!) even when you have an unexpected visitor, which reportedly brought about the name “Sorakitamochi”. One of the reasons why it was so easy to make is that in the old days, every house always had boiled sweet potatoes.",

    "history": "The salt water-packed wetlands that sit between fresh and sea water are called brackish lakes. There are 18 such lakes in Japan, and Nakaumi Lake, spanning the border between Shimane and Tottori Prefectures, is one of them.Among the foodstuffs representative of Nakaumi Lake is the blood clam. The formal name of this clam in Japanese is salubowgai and it is of a different type than what is generally known as a blood clam. Though the two look alike, a salubowgai’s shell has about 32 grooves while a blood clam’s shell has about 42 grooves. The sizes of the two also differ, with the salubowgai being smaller.In the Kojiki, it was a blood clam that healed the wound of the Hare of Inaba, whose skin had been ripped off.Until about the third decade of the Showa period (1950s), Nakaumi Lake was number one in Japan for blood clam production. However, because of land reclamation projects and a decrease in water quality, the size of catches there has been decreasing. By the sixth decade of Showa (1980s), the problem had become bad enough that the shipment of clams ceased. The second decade of the Heisei period (2000s) saw advancements in aquaculture, and in Heisei 25 (2013) the shipment of clams was restarted.In the Izumo region, blood clams are steamed with their shells on and then eaten. This dish in Japanese is called akagai no kara mushi or, locally, akagai garan mushi. There are several theories as to the origin of the word garan. Some say that it is an accented pronunciation of the standard word for shell, kara; others say that it comes from the sound made when shells are washed over a strainer to remove the sand stuck in their grooves, garan garan.",

Farmers used the stems for food, and it has spread as a wisdom of living. Nowadays, it is readily available at supermarkets in urban areas and is eaten by ordinary households, but reportedly this is a trend that began to emerge after the migration of people from rural areas to the cities. Farming housewives used to peel the stems of sweet potatoes and sell them at the Sunday market. The stems were important for the family's finances, as they generated additional income from them.

There are various theories about the origin of Suguki, including one that dates back to the Azuchi-Momoyama period when the prominent family of Kamigamo Shrine (a family serving the shrine) began cultivating it from the wild plants growing along the Kamo River, and another theory that involves receiving seeds from the Kyoto Imperial Palace.\"Suguki Pickles,\" which involves pickling Suguki simply with salt, is said to have originated in the early Edo period. Initially, it was a high-class pickle made exclusively by the shrine family and presented as an offering to the Imperial Palace. By the late Edo period, it started to be made by farmers around Kamigamo Shrine as well. However, due to a prohibition outlined in the \"Okakizuke-koujougaki\" that restricted taking Suguki out of the village, production was limited. After the Meiji Restoration, the popularity of Suguki increased, and it became widely available in the city.The making of \"Suguki Pickles\" involves three main steps: pre-pickling, primary pickling, and maturing in a warming chamber called \"muro.\" The muro is an artificially heated chamber maintained at around 40°C, promoting lactic acid fermentation. This method is now common, allowing Suguki to be ready to eat in about two weeks. In the past, instead of the muro, a natural fermentation method called \"Jikounare\" was used, allowing fermentation to occur naturally based on ambient temperatures. In this case, Suguki would be ready from spring to summer, and in the Edo period, it was cherished as a delicacy during the summer.",

    "history": "\"Sukiyaki\" is a dish where thinly sliced beef, along with ingredients like green onions, chrysanthemum greens, and grilled tofu, is cooked together in a broth made from a base of soy sauce, sugar, and sake. In traditional Tokyo establishments, the cooking method has evolved to involve heating a pot, melting beef fat in it, then sautéing the beef before adding the remaining ingredients and seasonings for simmering. This method, similar to the one used in Kansai (western Japan), became the mainstream after the Great Kanto Earthquake.In the mid-Edo period, there existed a dish in Kansai called \"uosuki\" or \"okisuki,\" where plows were used as grills to cook shellfish and fish. The term \"sukiyaki\" is believed to have originated from grilling beef with these plows and calling it \"suki-yaki.\" However, this is a Kansai-specific story.Since the imperial decree prohibiting meat consumption by Emperor Tenmu in 675 AD, cattle and horses were considered valuable labor assets, and their consumption was not publicly allowed until the Meiji Restoration. It was only after the opening of Yokohama in 1859, alongside the establishment of the British embassy in Edo's Takanawa in 1860, that orders for beef were received. However, it took an entire day to source beef in Yokohama. Thus, when a cattle processing facility was established in Shiba Shirokane, meat-eating culture spread, and restaurants serving a dish called \"gyunabe\" (beef hot pot) opened one after another in Tokyo, becoming a major trend. Gyunabe was considered a treat for commoners liberated from meat restrictions and could be seen as a representative dish of the civilization and enlightenment era.Initially, to mitigate the gamey odor, miso-based broths were predominant. As meat quality improved, additional ingredients like tofu and shirataki were included, and a sauce made with soy sauce, sugar, and sake was used for simmering. However, after the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, Tokyo's gyunabe restaurants suffered a significant setback, with most closing down. Subsequently, the name for the dish \"sukiyaki\" from Kansai was adopted in the Kanto region, where both specialized restaurants and households began using a method similar to that of Kansai for cooking. In Kansai, the meat is first grilled, and then broth and vegetables are added, while in Kanto, especially in homes, boiling the broth before adding both meat and vegetable",

As such, it was easy to obtain soybeans and salt there, the raw ingredients of miso.Miso remains deeply rooted in everyday life in Aichi even to this day, appearing in various dishes that are widely known outside the prefecture: “miso stew “and “udon noodles “, “miso oden “, “tonkatsu with miso sauce “, “miso dengaku “, and so on. But the most familiar miso dish eaten in summer is sumiso somen (vinegared miso noodles).Aichi was also lucky when it came to vinegar. Brewers in Handa city were able to produce sake vinegar at an affordable price, and this is said to have helped sushi (sushi referring to vinegared rice, not raw fish) become a part of Edo cuisine. The cities of Hekinan and Anjo, located near to Handa, have eaten somen (thin, wheat flour) noodles since ancient times, and it is thought that “sumiso somen” is deeply rooted in the area too.",

Generally, the term \"grilled mackerel sushi\" refers to \"stick sushi,\" but in the inland area of Shimane Prefecture, it sometimes refers to chirashi zushi, a type of sushi made of unrolled grilled mackerel.Through this district, mackerel caught off the Sea of Japan were often transported to various regions. Before the Meiji era (1868-1912), preservation techniques and transportation methods had not been established. As mackerel is called \"live spoilage\" when it is damaged quickly, grilled mackerel, which can be preserved relatively well, was a wisdom of life born from popular culture, and was a valuable food supplement for protein.",

In Tottori Prefecture, squid, or Japanese common squid, is harvested in autumn (from September to November). To preserve the taste of the harvested squid for a long period of time, and to prepare for the winter season when ingredients are hard to find, \"Surume-no koji zuke\" (squid marinated in rice koji(=malted rice)) was created. The characteristic of this dish is that it uses squid that has been dried in the sea breeze to reduce its odor and has a moderate saltiness, which gives it a deep flavor.The squid is then chopped and marinated in rice koji(=malted rice), and when aged, the squid is softened and becomes rich in flavor and umami. In the past, miso and soy sauce were also handmade at home, so rice koji(=malted rice) pickles were made in each household with each home having their own distinctive style and taste and is affectionately called,” Mother’s taste.” It is also commonly pickled with salted vegetables, but the vegetables used are varied. Cucumbers, perilla leaves, eggplants, chili peppers, wasabi, bell peppers, etc., became a colorful and popular flavor for each household. Nowadays, vacuum-packing technology has made it possible to preserve them for even longer periods of time, and they are widely eaten throughout Japan as a souvenir of Tottori Prefecture.",

Lotus root can be delivered throughout the year, but those harvested in summer are crisp and fresh, while those harvested in winter have a chunky texture, and you can enjoy a different taste depending on the time of harvest. Until around 1965, traditional smelt fishing in Kasumigaura had been carried out with sailing seine boats, which was a method unique to Kasumigaura. It is characterized by the boats' huge white sails, and the fishermen use the wind force to pull the seine. The sight of dozens of sailing boats with white sails floating on the lake was a famous feature of Kasumigaura. However, because fishing was not possible when there was no wind, and because the sails were so large that there was a high risk of capsizing when agitated by gusts of wind, fishing is now done by mechanical trawlers. In recent years, there has been an issue of declining catches due to overfishing. Smelt is popular with many people because its bones are soft and it can be eaten whole, making it easy to prepare.",

The flavor is said to be the best from around January to February.It is said that Codfish has been eaten in various places such as Edo or Kyoto since at least the Muromachi period. At that time, the internal organs of the fish were removed through the mouth without cutting the stomach and filled with salt to prevent the fish from rotting during transportation. These fish were well appreciated by the Samurai because the stomach was not cut, in other words, it was a food that did not make one think of Seppuku(=Harakiri).The living water temperature of Codfish, which is a type of cold-water fish, is as low as 2℃ to 4℃(≒35°F to 39°F). Therefore they are mostly found around Hokkaido where the ocean temperature is very low, and Hokkaido boasts the largest catch of cod in the country.

The southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture is a granary surrounded by Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, and the Tone River, which is said to have led to the production of a variety of rice cakes, including \"tagane mochi,\" made with glutinous and non-glutinous rice that is abundant in the area.Tagane mochi is made by mixing glutinous rice with Uruchi rice, which is usually eaten as rice. The shape is flat and oval like a sea cucumber, and they are eaten baked or fried. The rice cake is made by adding beans, aonori (green laver), or other ingredients, and each household has its own unique way of making tagane mochi.In Ishioka City and Kasumigaura City, they are traditionally made with aonori (green laver). In Ogo, in the northern part of the prefecture, soybeans and white sesame seeds are added, and in Hokota City, in the Kagyo region, shiso seeds are added.

The harmonious pairing of sea bream and turnip, enhancing each other's flavors, is referred to as \"Deaimon.\"The Shogoin turnip utilized in Tai Kabu is among Kyoto's traditional vegetables. Its roots can be traced back to the Kyoho era (1716-1736), when a farmer from the Shogoin area of Sakyo Ward brought back seeds of the Omi turnip, then cultivated in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture. Unlike regular turnips, it has an unusual oval shape, a distinct feature that is believed to be a result of deliberate cultivation practices.Renowned as the largest turnip in Japan, weighing from 4 to 5 kg, the Shogoin turnip is celebrated for its delicate and refined taste. Its cultivation gained popularity during the Tenpo era (1830-1844), especially for the Shogoin turnip pickles, known as \"Senmaizuke.\" Farmers use specific techniques in growing these turnips, diligently heaping soil and fertilizing to achieve their beautiful form. The Shino area of Kameoka City has become famous for Shogoin turnip production since its inception shortly after World War Two, with the unique temperature, fog, climate, and geography all contributing to ideal growth conditions. Most of the Senmaizuke produced in Kyoto is made from turnips harvested in this region. Kyoto Prefecture recognizes these turnips as part of its \"Kyoto traditional vegetables.\" These include vegetables that were introduced to today's Kyoto prefecture before the Meiji period and excludes mushrooms and ferns. The Shogoin turnip is a prime example of these.",

The fish grown in the Kurushima Straits off the coast of Imabari City, located about 30 km east of this site, are caught in the fast currents of the straits, and their flesh is firm and resilient.In Imabari City and other areas in the Toyo region, the whole fish is cooked together with rice, and after cooking, the fish is broken up and mixed with the rice. The flavor of the fish soaks into the rice and combines with the elasticity of the fish meat to create a very tasty dish. In the Nanyo region, including Uwajima City and Seiyo City, raw fillets are marinated in a sauce made of soy sauce, mirin, egg, sesame, and soup stock, and the sauce is served over hot rice. The Nanyo area is close to Kyushu, and since long ago, fishermen have fished in the Hyuga Sea off the coast of Oita and Miyazaki prefectures. It is said that this dish was originally prepared by fishermen who could not use fire on their boats. Horse mackerel, which was often caught, was used in many cases, but the dish made with the flamboyant sea bream came to be called \"taimeshi\" (sea bream rice).

    "prefecture": "Hiroshima Prefecture",
    "history": "“Taimeshi” is a local dish mainly eaten in the Seto Inland Sea coastal region. It’s made by putting a whole sea bream in a pot and cooking it with rice. It’s said that fishermen began making this dish during the Edo period when the village headman of Hashirishima started casting a sea bream fishing net. The Seto Inland Sea is characterized by a rocky and undulating seabed terrain, along with strong tidal currents, making it a suitable spawning environment and habitat for sea bream. As a result, sea bream fishing has thrived in the area since ancient times. Traditional fishing methods for sea bream, such as single-hook line fishing, abise fishing, floating sea bream fishing in Noshiro, and sea bream net fishing in Tomo, have been passed down through generations. Among them, Tomonoura in Fukuyama City is famous for the “taishibari net fishing method,” which is said to have started about 380 years ago in the Edo period. It’s a fishing method in which the sea bream that gather in the Seto Inland Sea to spawn in early summer are caught in nets all at once, and is now designated as an important intangible folk cultural property of Fukuyama City. From the beginning to middle of May you can watch the fishing from a boat and have the experience of actually pulling a net. In recent years, there has been a surge in red snapper aquaculture in the Seto Inland Sea. The practice of “harbor-based cultivation” involves releasing red snapper into the harbor and providing them with food for a specific period to encourage their settlement in the area. Additionally, the establishment of the first “marine ranch” off the coast of Osaki Kamijima Town has further promoted red snapper cultivation in the Seto Inland Sea.",

It does not lack sweetness and has a soft and flaky texture. It also has a unique viscosity. Large ones were made into \"taimo rice;\" it is said that this was a way to bulk up meals during the war when rice was difficult to obtain. Smaller ones were used as an ingredient in miso soup, candied mash, and stews. \"Zuiki,\" their dried stems, were harvested before the harsh winter came, peeled, dried and stored as a preserved food in people's homes.Sakawa Town, located in the mid-western part of the prefecture, flourished as the castle town of chief retainer Fukao of the Tosa Domain; even now sake breweries, sake storehouses, and old merchant houses are still part of the charming townscape. This area had similar taimo-eating customs as other areas; however, \"taimo no korobashi\" is a local food unique to this area. This is a dish that uses taimo and resembles \"nikkorogashi\" (root vegetables boiled in broth). It is distinct in that soy sauce and sugar are used to give it a salty-sweet flavor, with sesame sprinkled on as a finishing touch. It is said that it was named \"korobashi\" since the taimo is tossed (\"korobasu\") with sesame. Since the preparations take time, it is said that this was a dish made when there was time to spare.",

As the name \"takakibi\" implies, it grows up to 3 meters tall and produces ears with many small reddish-brown kernels at the tip. Perhaps due to the difference in climate, the takkibi is sticky and has a savory flavor unlike its Chinese counterpart. When dumplings are made from takakibi flour, they are smooth, mild, and delicious on the tongue. Making takkibi flour is a labor-intensive process. After the harvest is dried, the seeds are hung under the eaves and left for the next year. Next, the seeds are pounded patiently with a mallet to remove the husks. The seeds are then ground into flour, but it is important to remove the scum before milling. When the weather turns cold, the flour is soaked in water for about 10 days, and then drained and dried. When it is dry, it is ground with a mortar, sifted, and then dried in the sun to preserve the flour. For takakibi dumpling soup, root vegetables such as gobou(=burdock), carrots, radish, shiitake mushroom, and chikuwa(fish cake) are sauteed in oil and seasoned with Dashi (=Japanese soup stock) and soy sauce. Small dumplings made from kneaded takakibi flour are added to the soup.",

Nemagari bamboo is the young shoot of the sasa bamboo called \"chimazasa\" and is picked in mountainous regions. Because the bamboo shoots can be picked only during the short period at the height of early summer, these bamboo shoots arrive on the market in small quantities and are scarce and difficult to obtain. They are characteristic of regions with heavy snowfall and are said to have a good flavor without too much of a bitter taste. Some regions also use hachiku bamboo shoots. As for Takenoko jiru(Bamboo shoot soup), an indispensable ingredient is canned mackerel in brine. Canned mackerel became popular during the mid-1950s to mid-1960s. It was found to be convenient in ocean-less Nagano Prefecture, and it was formerly an expensive product. Putting mackerel into miso soup is a way of eating that is characteristic of the region. Add oil and flavor to a simple miso soup, and a good taste will develop that is indispensable to a bamboo shoot soup. The dish will be a fully delicious Takenoko jiru(Bamboo shoot soup) with just bamboo shoots and canned mackerel. Sometimes, put in something like onions, carrots, thin deep-fried slices of tofu, tofu, or beaten eggs.",

This is a simple dish of bamboo shoots and kelp simmered in soup stock. From the Edo period to the Meiji period, Kitamae-bune, a group of merchant ships that traveled between Hokkaido and Osaka, used the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture as a port of call. Because of this relationship, Kanazawa City received a large influx of kelp from Hokkaido.Because of this, it is clear that \"bamboo shoot kelp\" is a dish that combines two traditional ingredients.",

    "history": "The Shimada area was mostly surrounded by mountains and could not produce enough rice. A man named Ichirobe Yasumatsu, who was aware of this environment, cultivated the mountains and forests in 1846 (Koka 3). He moved the moso bamboo from Kiyomizu Temple in the town and began to increase the number of mother bamboos. The red clay soil encouraged the growth of Ichirobei's bamboo shoots, which grew quickly. Bamboo shoot cultivation spread to neighboring farmers, and soon \"Shimada bamboo shoots\" established an unshakeable position as a specialty product.Shimada bamboo shoots have fine fibers and soft flesh. The secret lies in the soil. Bamboo shoots grown in hard soil are tough, but those grown in the soil of the Shimada area, which has been cultivated by our ancestors, are soft. Shimada bamboo shoots grow deep in the ground. Traditionally, a pickaxe is used to dig bamboo shoots, but Shimada bamboo shoots are dug using a metal rod more than 1 meter long.Around 1975 (late 1970), 700 to 800 tons of bamboo shoots were harvested per season, but due to a lack of successors among farmers, the amount has decreased to a few dozen tons. Nevertheless, the popularity of bamboo shoots has not waned, and they are supplied both inside and outside of the prefecture.Local people are also familiar with bamboo shoots. Various dishes such as \"bamboo shoot sansho nimono\" (bamboo shoot simmered with Japanese pepper), \"bamboo shoot rice,\" and stir-fried bamboo shoots are served on the dinner table.",

According to one account, the founder of Kaiinji Jakusho-in temple in Nagaokakyo City, Douyuu, brought back Mosochiku (Moso bamboo) from China, which became the catalyst for its spread in the Kansai region.Nagaokakyo City is famous as a production area for bamboo shoots. The bamboo shoots in the Otokuni area of Nagaokakyo City adopt a unique cultivation method called the \"Kyoto-style softening cultivation method.\" The process begins with selecting parent bamboo shoots in early April, followed by steps such as fertilization, thinning, and adding soil. The bamboo shoots' growth is monitored until around January, with harvesting taking place in early March. The distinctive feature is the meticulous care throughout the year, including the use of straw and grass, and soil addition in various stages. Additionally, the western part of the region, extending to the Nishiyama mountain range, has many bamboo groves with acidic clay soil. With good drainage and sunlight, it provides an environment suitable for bamboo shoot cultivation.The \"Takenoko to Fuki, Namabushi no Taitan\" dish is a local specialty unique to Kyoto, which is far from the sea. \"Namabushi\" refers to a processed item where fresh bonito is filleted, then subjected to heating processes such as steaming or boiling, and smoked (roasted) only once. Repeating the smoking process multiple times results in firm bonito flakes. While it is commonly known as Namabushi in Eastern Japan, it refers to the same processed item called \"Namaribushi.\" While bonito flakes are often used for making dashi (Japanese soup stock), in the case of Namabushi, the flakes are loosened and used in various dishes.The season for bamboo shoots coincides with the time when Namabushi is distributed, making them a perfect match. Additionally, Fuki is at its softest during this time.",

The dried octopus is always soaked in water and softened before being eaten not eaten as it is, as is the case with the surume. Octopuses are caught using traditional methods, whereby octopus pots are submerged into the sea. The texture of octopus differs depending on where they are caught, and those from the Amakusa region are firm and chewy year-round. Octopuses caught in the Ariake Sea close to Nagasaki have little fat and are suitable for making dried octopus.In the past, octopuses were dried and preserved during the winter when they become scarce. They are used for “Tako meshi” because by drying them, their flavor becomes concentrated and delicious. The dried octopuses are soaked in water and cut into smaller pieces once soft and combined with gobou (=burdock), carrots, and hijiki. Some regions cook all the ingredients and rice together from the start while others flavor the other ingredients separately from the rice and then add them later to the cooked rice. The water used to soak the dried octopuses are used as “dashi” (=Japanese soup stock) and soy sauce, sake and sugar are added. In Itsuwa-machi, the “Tako Meshi” is made with dried octopus and rice only. National Route 324 in Ariake is called “Amakusa Ariake Octopus Street” and attracts many tourists.",

The environment off the coast of Mihara is particularly suitable for growing octopus because of its good water quality, stable water temperature, and rocky areas with abundant bait, and octopus fishing has been popular since the Edo period. Even today, the Seto Inland Sea is one of the most important habitats for octopus. The fast ocean currents in this area allow octopus to stick firmly to the rocks, making their legs thicker and shorter, and giving them a firmer, crunchier texture. The main method of octopus fishing in Mihara is \"takotsubo fishing\", in which the octopus body is not easily damaged. About 100 octopus cribs are attached to a rope about 100 meters long and sunk at intervals of several tens of meters to the bottom of the sea, as determined by each fisherman. No buoys or other landmarks are placed at this time, so fishing requires many years of intuition and experience. The octopus are immediately washed in salt water, vacuum-packed, and flash-frozen. The Mihara City Fisheries Cooperative Association has branded the octopus caught in Mihara under the name \"Mihara Yassa Octopus,\" after the local traditional event \"Mihara Yassa Festival\".",

In the late Taisho era, with the advent of radio broadcasting in Japan, a yatai food called \"radio-yaki\" was named after the cutting-edge technology of radio. In the early Showa era, takoyaki using octopus as a filling began to be sold at yatai in Osaka. Initially, it was eaten plain, but after the war, the introduction of rich sauce led to the establishment of the current style, where takoyaki is topped with sauce, aonori(=seaweed flakes), and bonito flakes, and served on a boat-shaped tray with toothpicks.

After being dissolved and filtered, it is allowed to dry outside to solidify. By repeatedly freezing it during intensely cold nights and sun-drying it during the day, the result is a naturally dried stick of kanten. ”Kanten” is characterized by being more elastic and hardening more firmly than either gelatin or agar. Since it can be dried and stored for long periods, it has been highly valued as a preserved food in Akita during the region’s long winters.In Akita, primarily in the southern regions, ”kanten” is always served at gatherings, and it has long been a familiar snack accompanying tea. At important family events, homemade dishes are served as torimawashi, which are passed from person to person. Because kanten can be cut into any number of pieces to match the number of people and conveniently packed up for people to take home, it is often served as a torimawashi dish.Among the many ”kanten” dishes, egg ”kanten” is particularly well known. However, it can be made in many different ways: by solidifying beaten eggs, egg soup, or boiled and mashed eggs. Another ”kanten” dish made using eggs which cannot be omitted is kaminari kanten (lit. “thunder kanten”), which is made by dissolving sugar and ”kanten” in a liquid, mixing in milk and eggs, and then solidifying it. This recipe has been handed down in the south of Akita, and it is said that those who could prepare this dish well would become “good wives”.",

    "history": "Tamagoyaki is a dish made by seasoning eggs and frying them thickly. In the Kanto region, it refers to “atsuyaki tamago,” a sweetly seasoned omelet that is fried until lightly browned, whereas in the Kansai region, it refers to “dashimaki tamago,” an omelet that is made with soup stock, fried without browning, and served with grated daikon radish.Eggs have been prized by people since ancient times as a “food that nourishes the spirit,” but in the imperial court, eating chicken was prohibited, and chickens were treated as useful animals that could tell the time, so along with other meat, eating them was prohibited for a long time. Cooking and eating chicken and eggs as ingredients began in the early Edo period when the ban on eating them was lifted. Due to the influence of the Nanban trade, people started eating chicken eggs, but they were still valuable. After that, a dish called “tamago fuwafuwa,” a dish in which beaten eggs were poured into boiling stock and steamed, became popular as a delicacy for the commoners of the Edo period. This is said to be the origin of tamagoyaki.Oji Ogiya, which appeared on stage in the rakugo story “Oji no Kitsune (Fox of Oji)” and was also depicted in Hiroshige Utagawa's “Edo Komei Kaitei Zukushi,” is a hand-fried tamagoyaki shop that remains faithful to the original taste even now. At that time, there were many tea houses and restaurants in the area around Asukayama, Oji, which was said to be famous for its cherry blossoms, and Ogiya was one of them.Edo-style tamagoyaki is characterized by its sweet, deep flavor and chewy texture, with the flavorful umami of bonito stock. Today, it has become a staple in every household, and thanks to the widespread use of Teflon-based rectangular frying pans, it is easy to fry and continues to be a favorite for lunch boxes.",

Farmers cultivated black soybeans for shipping and for their own consumption using the paths in the rice paddies. The black soybeans are grown along these paths and those that could not be shipped were used to make snacks for children and a feast at rice planting time.The black soybean rice was offered to the god of rice paddies during the “sabiraki” (early opening of rice seedlings) ceremony (an event to pray for the growth of seedlings) held in June. Freshly cooked black soybean rice is rolled up like a rice ball, wrapped in a magnolia leaf, and offered to the altar. The fragrance of the magnolia leaves and chestnut trees repels insects, so the ritual is said to be a wish that the rice would grow without insects.",

Taimo are a local specialty of Okinawa, and are a variety of taro cultivated in clean water paddies.Also called mizuimo, in Okinawa Prefecture they are well-known and called tammu. Since the secondary and tertiary taro corm grow around the parent taro, it is considered a portentous ingredient for the flourishing of one's descendants, and is indispensable for celebratory meals. Okinawa Prefecture's taimo has a unique fragrance and stickiness, and is used especially for New Year's and Obon, but since one must wait nearly a year to harvest it, it is said that farmers calculate in reverse when they need to plant it. It is sold in storefronts not in its raw form, but steamed. Even nationally Okinawa Prefecture is one of the leading production areas, of which Kin and Oyama in Ginowan are famous. Dishes that use taimo include \"durwakashi,\" in which taimo, muji (taimo stems), pork, shiitake, and kamaboko are roughly chopped, steamed thoroughly in pork broth and then kneaded, and \"muji no jiru\" (muji, pork, and tofu miso soup) which is made for celebrating a birth. In recent years it has become increasingly used in pies and sweets-making. In the beginning of the 18th century in Shuri Kingdom in Okinawa, taimo was used as a ceremonial food which was offered to the gods on New Year's Day. \"Imo Orime\" Festival was enthusiastically held on the northern part of the main Okinawan island as well, from which it can be surmised that imo (taro) were an important ceremonial ingredient.",

In the region, the term \"tara\" often refers to Pacific cod (madara) more than Alaskan pollock (sketoudara).Nanao City, historically a thriving port town, is renowned for its winter yellowtail, but for locals, cod is a more familiar ingredient. Due to the intricate geography of Nanao Bay, cod, especially during the spawning season, has been abundantly caught. In the late 1940s, locals nostalgically recall an era when cod was so plentiful that they would say, \"cod is popping up.\" This sentiment is supported by local folk songs dedicated to Nanao's cod, and every February, the \"Gottsoo Matsuri\" (Cod Festival) is held.Known for having \"no wasted parts,\" cod is used in miso soup and simmered dishes, and its stomach and organs are used in salted fish roe. In dishes like \"tarachiri\" and \"tara-jiru,\" not only the flesh but also the complete set of internal organs, known as the \"seven tools,\" are utilized. In the past, it was common to see dried cod hanging from the eaves of houses as winter approached.Normally, due to its quick deterioration, cod is commonly prepared by cooking. However, in the Noto region, where fresh cod is readily available, it can also be enjoyed as sashimi. Moreover, \"tarako\" (cod roe) coated sashimi, known as \"tara no ko-tsuke,\" is widely known both within and outside the region and has become a classic local dish in Kanazawa City.",

The pork used in this dish is thinner than the typical pork cutlet found in other katsudon dishes, and it is coated with a light batter.

The western cuisine culture also thrived early on, with Western-style restaurants lining the stalls in Nishi-Hori. The origin of \"Tare Katsu Don\" is associated with one of the early established longstanding restaurants in this area. It is said to have originated in the early Showa period when the bold idea of generously pouring soy sauce-based sauce over the modern dish of cutlets and placing it on rice was introduced.

Edo-style tempura uses fresh seafood and sesame oil, which one eats freshly fried, one after another. Its origin is reported to be the fritters of western European cuisine which were propagated by Portugal in the mid-16th century. However, there were restrictions to cooking that used a great deal in Japan at the time, and it wasn’t until the Edo period when the production of canola oil increased that tempura was popularized. In Edo, which developed as a boom town in the Edo period, street stall businesses flourished as a way for commoners to eat out; tempura was one of these. The invention of small charcoal grills also pushed its popularity. The oil drainage was apparently poor, so it was stuck on skewers and served with grated daikon. In the latter half of the Edo period, a careful scrutiny of the frying method and ingredients led to the development of crisply fried tempura as haute cuisine. Tempura had also only been consumable as a street-stall food due to fire safety precautions, but ryotei (traditional Japanese restaurants) and tempura specialty shops spread from the Meiji period on, settling tempura’s status as haute cuisine. After that, tempura chefs who lost their jobs in the Great Kanto Earthquake migrated all over Japan, and Edo-style tempura spread throughout the country. In modern times as well, tempura, like sushi, is popularized in a wide range of forms, from household side dishes for the masses to exquisite cuisine such as high-end tempura restaurants.",

The origin of sekihan is said to be a relic from the ancient rice (akagome) that was offered to the gods, the ancestor to modern rice and a near-red color, or because red is used to dispel evil spirits. Until the Edo period, it was normal to eat ancient rice, but with technological developments in selective breeding, rice has transformed into its current-day strain. However, since the custom of offering red rice to the gods and then eating it was deeply ingrained, sekihan, white rice dyed with azuki beans, began to spread in the mid-Edo period.Akita has a dearly loved bean nicknamed \"tenko azuki\" (black-eyed pea), which is used there for sekihan. Akita's sekihan is also unique in that it uses sugar, which is different from typical sekihan. Black-eyed peas bleed color better than typical azuki beans, and because people dislike using the split hulls of azuki beans for the auspicious sekihan, they used black-eyed peas whose skin stays intact and doesn't easily split. The slightly purple-tinged color of sekihan made with black-eyed peas is unique to Akita. Sekihan is made without exception for Obon, New Year's, and important ceremonies in the family, and there is also the custom of eating it as \"kokuhan\" (black rice) on the sad occasions of observing the peaceful death of someone who has respectably lived their natural span of life.",

This taste of Sanuki is an essential drinking accompaniment or side dish. Until recently in Kagawa prefecture, where rainfall is low, reservoirs were mainly used to supply irrigation water for agriculture. There are over 10,000 reservoirs in the prefecture, and it has the highest density of reservoirs in Japan relative to the total area of the prefecture (Kagawa prefecture website). These reservoirs are inhabited by crucian carp, and from autumn to winter, when the reservoirs are drained after the busy farming season, the carp begin to spawn and become firm and fatty, without the odor typically associated with freshwater fish. It is referred to as \"Kanbuna\" (winter carp), and has long been an valuable protein source in the diet of people in agricultural and rural areas far from the sea. Teppai is a dish that makes the most of the delicious flavor of winter carp. The season for crucian carp is winter. The fattiness, lack of odor, and firmness make is so delicious that it is given the name \"Kanbuna\" (winter carp). Even today, crucian carp are cultivated in about 300 reservoirs in the prefecture. With one of the highest production volumes in the country, they are not only sold within the prefecture as a regional cuisine, but also shipped outside the prefecture. The name \"Teppai\" is said to come from a regional pronunciation of the \"Teppo-ae,\" with teppo being another name for crucian carp.",

The fishing season typically starts in May and concludes in August, with the initial catch of \"Tsukushi Tobiuo\" occurring relatively early in the season.\"Tobiuo(=Flying fish)\" have muscular, lean flesh with minimal fat, offering a mild and delicate flavor. True to their name, flying fish are capable of gliding through the air for several meters. Exploiting this unique characteristic, there is a distinctive method of \"Tobiuo(=Flying fish)\" fishing known as \"Ago Sukui.\" During the night, bright lights or torches are illuminated on boats, attracting \"Tobiuo(=Flying fish)\". The fish are then caught using large nets. It is reported that between 600 to 900 fish can be caught in a single night. The spectacle of \"Tobiuo(=Flying fish)\" leaping out of the water has led to the designation of \"Tobiuo(=Flying fish)\" as the prefectural fish of Shimane, a recognition received in 1989.",

Since then, the meals continued to be cooked with sour doburoku, as well as takikomi rice.

The taste is very delicate, and when you chew it, you can smell the soft tofu.The development of fishing ports was slow in the Edo period, so fish was a precious food and was not eaten by the common people. Therefore, the theory is that it started when Mitsunaka Ikeda, the lord of the Tottori Domain, issued an order to “eat tofu instead of fish.” Tofu was encouraged because it supplemented protein, so the people thought, “can’t we create a new dish with tofu?”' and came up with “tofu chikuwa,” which uses tofu instead of fish meat.

Tofu is believed to have originated in China and was introduced to Japan by Japanese envoys to the Tang Dynasty. During the Heian period, the aristocracy is said to have eaten tofu, which was referred to as \"okabe\" in a wives' tale. However, it wasn't until the Edo period that tofu became widely available to the general public. At that time, farmers had a custom of dancing to taiko drums in the rice paddies during rice planting and festivals. This dance, known as \"dengaku-mai\" (dengaku dance), is said to have inspired the name \"tofu dengaku.\" The Iga region is the birthplace of Kan'ami and Ze'ami, who are associated with Noh drama. The dance resembles a skewered tofu dancer dressed in white and dancing on a one-legged stick. It is thought to have been named \"tofu dengaku\" because the skewered tofu resembles the Takashoku dance, in which the dancers are dressed in white and dance with a single stick. Shisei Tanigawa mentioned the word \"dengaku\" in his \"Wakun Shiori\" (Book of Japanese Precepts). According to the book, \"The name 'dengaku' is derived from the fact that it resembles the appearance of a dengaku master dancing on a pole.” That's why the name has remained unchanged from the late Edo period to the present.",

Homemade tofu and barley miso are made using soybeans and barley grown in slash-and-burn fields in the \"mountainous Gokansho (Izumi, Yatsushiro City)\" area and Itsuki Village. The tofu, which has been soaked in miso for about six months, has a cheesy flavor and can be used as a side dish with rice or as an appetizer with alcohol, making it a valuable preserved food in areas with poor logistics. \"Kazura tofu\", which is made in the Ayugaeri district of Sakamoto-cho, Yatsushiro City, is made by putting weights on the tofu and thoroughly draining the moisture during the hardening process. It got its name because it is so hard that it can also be carried around by tying it with \"tsutakazura (a generic term for vine grass)\". Also, in Itsuki Village, there is a type of tofu called “kashinoki tofu,” which has a hard texture and is also made with plenty of soybeans. This kind of hard tofu is suitable for misozuke, so the tofu is squeezed well so that it can be stored for a long time at room temperature and then dried over low heat before being pickled in miso with a high salt content.Currently, it is produced in various parts of the prefecture and sold as a specialty product. Variations made using \"moromi\" such as “yamauni tofu” and “hiden tomei” are well known, and those with low salt content, smooth texture, and mellow taste became mainstream. There are also many variations, such as adding \"yuzu pepper\" or red chili pepper, and it goes well with various alcoholic beverages, including shochu, sake, and wine. Horses naturally have a higher body temperature than cows and pigs, making it difficult for bacteria that can cause food poisoning to grow, which is also why horse meat can be eaten raw. In addition, the meat is now disassembled at a meat processing plant under strict sanitary control and frozen before distribution in all cases. In this manner, all possible precautions against parasites are taken.",

The flavorful aroma of the crispy miso marinated with pork complements rice well, making it a delightful dish.Its roots date back to the end of the Edo period. During that time, samurai disliked consuming meat from quadrupeds like cows, pigs, and wild boars. Once, a large group of people gathered in the Ogino Mountain Clan (current vicinity of Atsugi City), and there was a shortage of food. They coated miso on the meat of wild boars and grilled it, not revealing what kind of meat it was. This turned out to be highly praised, marking the beginning of \"ton-zuke.\"With the modernization and cultural evolution, the culture of consuming meat spread in Japan. In Kanagawa Prefecture, especially in areas with ports, pig farming became popular. At one point, Atsugi had around 300 pig farms, and eventually, \"ton-zuke\" became recognized as a local specialty. Presently, it's also enjoyed in neighboring Zama City and Sagamihara City.",

The number of broilers raised in Miyazaki ranked number 1 in Japan in 2018.This dish has long been eaten in the town of Shintomi of central Miyazaki prefecture. To pass on this tradition, an association of farmers who inherited the traditional recipe participated in the “Gotochi (=local) Gourmet Contest” held in 2011 and won. “Tori Meshi” is also know as “Kasuga Zushi” which comes from the Kasuga district of Shintomi-cho.",

Among them, “Karaage” is the most famous, but “Tori-Ten”, deep-fried chicken in Tempura Flour, is also widely popular throughout Oita Prefecture.In the days when chicken was an expensive ingredient, \"Tori-Ten\" was made at home with plenty of batter. The thick batter increased the amount of chicken so that everyone could enjoy the chicken, even if the family was large.“Tori-Ten\" is said to have originated at the prefecture's first restaurant, Toyoken, in Beppu City. In the early Showa period, the fried chicken on the menu at the time was made with bones, which made it difficult for women to eat. So the dish was made by cutting boneless chicken thighs into bite-size pieces and arranging them in a Tempura style. The crispy and soft batter, which cooks faster than fried chicken, quickly became popular, and soon a variety of restaurants began to offer “Tori-Ten”.",

They are representative of local dishes that make use of dried kelp shavings. Although Toyama Prefecture is one of the largest consumers of kelp in Japan, kelp is actually rarely harvested in the prefecture. The origin of the kelp culture in Toyama can be traced back to the Kitamaebune ships that operated along the Japan Sea coast during the Edo period (1603-1867). The ships, which transported local specialties from around the country, made Toyama (Etchū) a port of call, where large quantities of kelp from Hokkaido was purchased. The culture is also closely related to the fact that many Toyama residents who immigrated to Hokkaido as pioneers during the Meiji period (1868-1912) sent kelp to their relatives in their hometowns. Today, most kelp is still produced in Hokkaido.Tororo kombu is made by layering several kinds of vinegar-pickled kelp, letting it harden, and shaving the surface. During this shaving process, the color of the kelp changes from black on the surface to white in the middle. Black tororo kombu, which is unique to Toyama Prefecture, is extremely sour, while its white counterpart is less sour and has a softer texture. With its perfect balance of moderate sourness and flavor, tororo kombu is the perfect accompaniment to fluffy cooked white rice.",

Some areas still retain this custom today.This custom is an old way of welcoming the New Year and dates back to the days when the lunar calendar was used. According to the old calendar, the day began after sunset, so the new year was celebrated whereby New Year's Day began from the evening of New Year's Eve. In those days, age was expressed by counting the year of birth as being one years old, so by celebrating New Year's Day, one more year was added to one's age.

In recent years, the number of small ones has been increasing due to breeding, but in the past, they were large and were often eaten during the postwar period when food was scarce. “Early Togan\" are not popular because of the white powder that sticks to the hands, and in recent years, “Ryukyu Togan\" have become the most commonly cultivated variety.Since it has a light flavor and is easily seasoned, it is used in a variety of dishes, such as miso soup, simmered dishes, and stir-fried dishes.

Sakuramasu is one of the most iconic fishes of Yamagata Prefecture, and it was designated as the prefectural fish in 1992.“Trout Ankake” was first eaten during the Edo period. It is believed that the tradition of cooking with “Ankake”, a thick savory sauce, came to the Shonai region after being introduced by merchant ships passing through Osaka and Hokkaido. It is still a popular dish today for celebrations and special occasions. Since Ankake sauce uses sugar and kudzu flour, which were very scarce ingredients at the time, it was most likely that trout ankake was a dish served when entertaining house guests.",

In 1978, Ibaraki Prefecture began breeding soba varieties to create \"Hitachi Aki Soba,\" which is a high-quality brand name in terms of both taste and aroma. Its aroma has gained such a reputation that it is used at some of the best soba restaurants in the Tokyo area, and has many fans outside of the prefecture as well. In Ibaraki Prefecture, where root vegetables are plentiful, \"Kenchin Jiru\" is often made, and it has become customary to eat \"Kenchin Jiru\" with soba noodles.

The history of “Tsukeage” dates back to the Edo period (1603 - 1867), when Shimazu Nariakira, the 28th head of the Satsuma domain, took a cue from the Kishu-hanpen and kamaboko (steamed fish paste) that had been passed down through the generations in other domains and deep fried them to make them more suitable for the hot and humid climate of Kagoshima Prefecture. There is another theory that the name of the Ryukyu dish \"chikiagi\" (fried kamaboko) corrupted to \"Tsukeage\". “Tsukeage” is made by mixing fish paste, tofu and Kagoshima's local sake, and frying them in oil. The most common fish ingredients are mainly horse mackerel, mackerel and flying fish. Lizardfish, pike conger, and white croaker are also used for high-quality products. \"Tsukeage” of Kagoshima Prefecture is characterized by the sweetness of the sugar. The local sake used for \"Tsukeage\" is also used for \"Sake-zushi\", a local cuisine in Kagoshima Prefecture. Lye is added to the refined sake from the process of making sake and then squeezed out. It is also called \"Kuroki” (black sake) or \"akumochizake\" and is used as a substitute for mirin or drunk as a New Year’s spiced sake. In the past, Kagoshima Prefecture's mild climate made it unsuitable for the production of traditional sake, but instead the production of Kuroki (akumochizake) became more popular. Since it is not cooked, it remains rich in amino acids and brings out the flavor of the fish in \"Tsukeage\".",

    "history": "Shimane Prefecture has a coastline 1.026 km (637 miles) long, the 10th longest in the country. Offshore, the Tsushima warm current flows toward the northeast, providing an ideal environment for fishing. Fishing methods are diverse, including seine, trawl, set-net, and single-line fishing. The offshore smelt, horse mackerel, and flying fish harvested by these fishing methods are made into surimi, which is then made into tsumire (fish ball) with gobou(=burdock) and green onion, and eaten as tsumire-ni (stewed fish ball) or tsumire-jiru (soup with tsumire).In particular, \"tsumire-ni\" (simmered offshore smelt) is recommended by the locals. One piece of Okigisu, which is not so big (about 20 cm in length), is not so satisfying to eat. If you mince several of them together and make tsumi-ni, you can save time and effort in cooking. Okigisu is the local name for the fish, and its official name is \"Nigisu\". In some areas, it is also called \"Tonkoro iwashi\" .Okigisu are readily available throughout the year. A long time ago, a familiar sight at fresh fish stores was a box full of okigisu lined up on the shelves. Because they are relatively inexpensive, they are often served at the dinner table. The fish is fatty all year round, and some locals say that it is \"as good as Saury”. It is a white-fleshed fish with no peculiarities.",

Since the Edo period, it has also been highly regarded as a non-perishable food with a long shelf life, suitable for serving to guests. Hence, each of the non-perishable ingredients are thoroughly cooked. Although it may appear similar to \"Shira-ae\" (a tofu and vegetable salad), the tofu is boiled in before use. It is then combined with other ingredients, such as pre-seasoned dried shiitake mushrooms, shredded carrots, burdock root, and dried shrimp, along with seasonings like bonito stock and soy sauce. In the Shūnan region, it is often enjoyed during summer, especially during the Bon Festival. For those who have left their hometown, it remains a beloved taste of home.",

The resulting broth is rich, and the soft texture is crafted to be palatable to people of all ages.\"Uchimame-jiru\" is often served as an offering during the Buddhist memorial service at temples. It serves as a valuable source of protein during the harsh winter in the Kohoku region and is considered an essential dish during this season. In the Azuchi-Shimotoyoura area in Omihachiman City, \"Uchimame-jiru\" is said to be a ceremonial soup served during pilgrimage to Ise-ko. In addition to smashed soybeans, it includes satoimo(=Japanese taro), zuiki (taro leaf stalk), tofu, and fried thin tofu. The hearty \"Uchimame-jiru\" also contains turnips, satoimo(=Japanese taro), daikon radish, and, notably, Nobunaga negi (green onions). Slowly simmering these ingredients enhances their sweetness, resulting in a more delicious flavor. Nobunaga negi is a thick white onion cultivated in the Azuchicho area of Omihachiman City, named after Oda Nobunaga, who lived boldly and independently. It is in season from late November to the end of March, and its sweetness intensifies when thoroughly cooked. Uchimame is also used in simmered dishes.",

During the reigns of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and Yoshimasa, tea cultivation was encouraged and tea gardens were opened in Uji City.

The \"chanoyu,\" or the appreciation of tea utensils and decorations for the tea ceremony, was born and spread to the masses. In the mid-Edo period, the \"Uji method\" was established by Nagatani Soen. This method involved rubbing steamed tea sprouts over a roasting furnace and then drying them. Tea made using this method became popular in Edo (Tokyo) and was well known throughout the country.Today, Uji City, Wazuka Town, Minamiyamashiro Village, and other areas in the Yamashiro region of southern Kyoto Prefecture, as well as the Nakatan and Tango regions, are the main tea-producing areas.There are various types of Uji tea. There are sencha, made by steaming and rubbing sprouts grown in the open air; gyokuro, made by covering the sprouts to prevent direct sunlight; tencha, made by avoiding direct sunlight like gyokuro and not rubbing the steamed leaves; and matcha, a powdered form of tencha.Uji matcha is the highest grade of tea, and is also used to make ice cream and ice cream.

Initially, plum trees were planted in the land near castles to produce military provisions. In the Edo period, travelers passing through Hakone found Odawara's preserved plums useful as a side dish that would prevent their bento box lunch from spoiling. Pickled fresh plums appeared as a local Odawara specialty suited to hiking along the Tokaido road between Tokyo and Kyoto. In the present day, plums are grown in large numbers at the Soga Plum Grove, which ranks among the three biggest plum groves in the Kanto region. Odawara can boast of producing the most plums of anywhere in Kanagawa. The juuroume breed, grown only to Odawara, has thick, soft flesh, and is held to be the best variety of plum for umeboshi.The local area has developed various dishes, new and old, that use the familiar plum as an ingredient, including those that use plum extract and plum jam.

The Tanabe fief of the Kishu domain covered plenty of barren land, and the farmers were burdened by heavy annual tribute payments. To alleviate the farmers’ hardship, Naotsugu Ando, the lord of the Tanabe domain, turned his attention to the yabu-ume plum, which grew wild in the barren land, and encouraged the farmers to cultivate it. This is believed to be the beginning of large-scale plum cultivation in Wakayama Prefecture. In addition to the mild climate, the region was surrounded by small hills and received ample sunlight, making it suitable for plum cultivation, and as a result plum cultivation took hold in the southern part of the prefecture. The high-quality umeboshi produced in this region came to be known as “Tanabe plums”, and were highly praised, even in Edo.After the Meiji period, the demand for umeboshi increased as they were used for military rations during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars as well as World War II, leading to an increase in production. In addition, the demand for umeboshi also increased due to cholera and dysentery outbreaks during the period spanning 1877-1887.The large, thick-fleshed nanko-ume plum was selected and registered as a variety in 1965 after many years of searching for a superior strain. Every year from the end of January to the end of February, plum blossoms bloom in plum groves, with “a million petals in a single glance, with a fragrance that spreads for ten li”.",

The sight of dozens of sailboats with white sails floating on the lake was famous in Kasumigaura. However, because it was impossible to fish when there was no wind, and because the sails were so large, it was risky to fish with them in a gust of wind. Therefore, fishing is now carried out by mechanical trawlers.

Instead, crops such as soba (=buckwheat), corn, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains were cultivated as staple foods. Among them, wheat had high utility, and the development of flour culture was inevitable, as evidenced by \"houtou\" being a specialty of Yamanashi Prefecture, becoming ingrained in people's lives for many years. \"Usuyaki\" is a type of flour-based dish that allows for flavor variations with different ingredients and is easy to make. It was not only enjoyed as a home snack but also consumed as a light meal during daily agricultural work due to its portability. Some variations included adding local vegetables, shiso (Japanese basil), beans, while others kept it simple with just wheat flour, often enjoyed with sugar or sweet soy sauce.",

The fierce-looking utsubo only consumed in several regions, including the southern region of Wakayama Prefecture. There are about 200 recognized species of utsubo, most of which are 1-1.5 meters long and weigh 1-5 kilograms. Utsubo are in season from November to March, but those caught during the cold season are more delicious because they are fatty and do not smell as much. The flesh of utsubo is white, translucent, and elastic, with a light flavor. In addition to being rich in protein, calcium, and iron, the gelatin between the flesh and skin is rich in collagen.In Wakayama Prefecture, utsubo are often dried before being eaten, and the sight of large quantities of cut open utsubo being dried is common during the fall and winter fishing seasons in the southern part of the prefecture. Utsubo tsukudani, made by frying dried utsubo and boiling it in soy sauce, is a particular regional specialty. In addition to tsukudani, utsubo is also used in hot pots, sashimi, seared utsubo dishes, fried dishes, etc. Its white flesh, which does not have a strong flavor, goes well with all kinds of dishes and can be eaten in various ways, making it a favorite delicacy in the fall and winter since ancient times.",

There is also a tradition to keep your eyes down when serving and eating. There is a similar dish in Yamaguchi Prefecture, which is said to have been handed down along with Buddhist beliefs, and some believe that animal products were not used originally. In 1939, “Uzume-meshi” was selected by the Imperial Household Agency as one of the \"Five Famous Types of Japanese Rice\" along with “Sayori-meshi” from Gifu Prefecture, “Fukagawa-meshi” from Fukagawa, Tokyo, “Chushichi-meshi” from Ogawa town, Saitama Prefecture, and “Kayaku-meshi” from the Namba region of Osaka.",

It is said that \"mizutaki (chicken stew)\" is always served at the end of the Hakata Gion Yamakasa festival called Naorai, where all the participants eat sake and food offered to the gods. It is said that this is because the men who ascended the heavy Yamakasa float chose to eat chicken in order to strengthen their bodies.Hakata Jidori, developed independently by Fukuoka Prefecture in 1999, is a brand of jidori chicken born from the crossbreeding of the native species Sazanami and White Plymouth Rock, and was created based on the idea of \"making Fukuoka Prefecture's local dishes, such as chikuzen-ni (stewed chicken stew) and mizutaki (stewed chicken stew), more delicious.

The pleasant smell of the ocean spreading its fragrance is a well-known spring scene among the locals. The dried seaweed is then eaten as \"wakame musubi,\" a type of rice ball topped with wakame. In the past, many families used to go to the sea to pick wakame seaweed by themselves, chop it up after it was dried, and put it in cans. Dried wakame could be served as it is over rice, but it was often added to lunch boxes as \"wakame musubi,\" and it is still loved today as a taste of one's hometown. The history of this dish dates back to the Edo period (1603-1867), when it was served at an inn in Yashima during the Edo period (1603-1868). There is an anecdote that a maid was surprised when she saw a samurai from the Choshu domain sprinkling chopped wakame she had brought with her on top of rice, saying, \"Samurai from Choshu eat rice with tea leaves on it.",

The wakamegi grown in this region is characterized by its sweet flavor and gentle aroma. In the Taisho and early Showa periods, the area was already a production center, and in the 1960s, it became possible to harvest all year round. Then, with the spread of plastic greenhouse cultivation, it became possible to harvest stably even in the coldest season, and production volume increased greatly. The largest amount of harvest is available in the market from December to March. Especially from the end of February to the beginning of March is the peak season, and during this period, wekegi is sweeter and has more umami flavor.

There is a record of sharks being brought to this area from merchants on the Sea of Japan coast during the Edo period (1603-1868). Since sharks can last for a long time due to their high ammonia content and can be eaten as sashimi for about half a month, they began to be eaten as sashimi at home when fishermen from Shimane Prefecture began bringing them in the late 1890s. In the days when transportation was not developed, fresh seafood was difficult to obtain in mountainous areas far from the sea, and sharks were valued. Since the smell of ammonia becomes stronger as time goes by, it is often eaten with ginger soy sauce to remove the smell. Some families also ate it with sugar soy sauce. It is mainly eaten at festive occasions such as autumn festivals, New Year's, and celebrations, etc. In Miyoshi City, there is an old saying of hospitality, \"Eat alligator until your stomach gets cold. There are about 20 species of sharks eaten in Miyoshi City and other parts of northern Hiroshima Prefecture, including the common ratshark, blue shark, and hammerhead shark. The color of the meat differs depending on the species, and the reddish sharks resemble swordfish, with a low fat content and soft, light flesh. Because of its taste, the shark is sometimes called \"Miyoshi swordfish\" in Miyoshi City and \"Nishijo tuna\" in Nishijo Town, Shobara City. It is caught throughout the year, but is more delicious in fall and winter, when its flesh is firmer and tastier.",

Bracken starch is made from the starch contained in bracken roots, and it is extremely rare and valuable because it is laborious to produce and only a small amount can be harvested. For this reason, commercially available \"warabimochi\" is often made with starch from sweet potato, tapioca, or kudzu. In the past, there was a superstition that you could drive away the monsters that emerged from the Uguisuzuka Tumulus on Mt. Wakakusa by burning the mountain. From this superstition, people who passed Mt. Wakakusa began starting fires, which spread to the Todaiji temple grounds and nearby temples, causing constant danger. Eventually, Todaiji Temple, Kofukuji Temple, and the Nara magistrate's office, which are all adjacent to Mt. Wakakusa, became involved in the mountain burning. Lots of bracken sprang up after the mountain was burned, and the deer in Nara Park did not eat it so it grew in large amounts and eventually became a production area for bracken starch. This gave rise to the \"Wakakusa Yamayaki,\" a traditional event that signals the arrival of spring in the ancient capital of Nara.",

Currently, wasabi is cultivated without the use of fertilizers as much as possible by creating stepped wasabi fields in mountainous areas with spring water, and the \"Traditional Cultivation of Shizuoka Water Wasabi\" has been recognized as a World Agricultural Heritage and Japan Agricultural Heritage.Wasabi pickles were first sold in Shizuoka Station, which opened in 1889, and are still one of the most popular Shizuoka souvenirs, and are often served at home.

White shrimp is popular as a topping for sushi and sashimi in restaurants, but “white shrimp kakiage” is quite popular in households. The deep-fried shrimp is crispy, fragrant, and holds a unique sweetness. White shrimp also have the distinction of not turning red when cooked, unlike other shrimp.",

Whitebait from Matsue has been valued highly since the Edo period, with restaurants all over the country endorsing it as the best in Japan.The fish range from 5-10cm in length. They are transparent when at their freshest, but turn opaque after a few hours. While often confused with the similar-looking ice goby, they are an entirely different species, inhabiting different areas.Whitebait is caught in Lake Shinji between November and May, mainly with trout nets and gill nets. It has long been known as \"the fish that signals spring\"; some locals even say that if you don't eat whitebait, the spring won't come. In ancient times, it was said that one could see whitebait fishing from the Matsue Bridge. Documents from the Meiji period contain descriptions of canneries in Matsue city, where whitebait would be packed into cans.Fresh whitebait can be eaten raw as sashimi, allowing you to appreciate its flavor and firm texture. There are many other preparations of whitebait to savor in Matsue, including vinegar dressings and egg-drop soups. One of these is whitebait tempura, a regular fixture at local restaurants as an accompaniment to udon noodles or a bowl of rice. It allows you to enjoy the soft, light texture of tempura, together with the umami taste of whitebait, which is increased by deep-frying.",

    "history": "The Kuma River, Kumamoto's largest first-class river, runs through the Hitoyoshi Basin, flows through the Yatsushiro Plain, and empties into the Yatsushiro Sea. It has long been known as a source of ayu because of its rapid current, which is one of the three most rapid rivers in Japan, and the quality of its water, which is said to be clear. The reason for this is that the ayu's body is trained by the fierce current, and the clear water allows sunlight to reach the bottom of the river, which provides an abundance of algae as food. The Kawabe River, a tributary of the Midorigawa River, is especially famous for catching large ayu, called shaku-ayu, which are about 30 cm in length. The town of Kosa, through which the Midorigawa River flows, is home to fish weirs, and restaurants serving ayu dishes are also popular. The town is a treasure trove of ayu, and there are a variety of specialties such as grilled ayu and ayu sushi, but grilled ayu is a winter preserve unique to the area. After being skewered and roasted over a charcoal fire to a golden brown, it was dried in a drying kiln and used as a soup stock for New Year's zoni or takikomi-gohan (rice cooked in a pot). Another preserved winter food is nandoro-ni (sweetened soy sauce stew), which is made by slowly simmering grilled ayu in a sweet soy sauce sauce for a long time. Finally, syrup is added to give the fish a nice shine. The ayu is edible down to the bones, and the meat is plump. Ayu with eggs are also a delicacy during this season.However, the catch of ayu, which used to be abundant until the mid-Showa period, has been decreasing in the Kuma River and its estuary. The Kuma River Fisheries Cooperative Association has been working to protect the ayu resource by, for example, scooping up young ayu at weirs along the way and releasing them into the entire basin, because dams and multiple weirs prevent them from migrating upstream.",

In the plains of Gunma Prefecture, a double cropping of rice and wheat has been widely practiced since ancient times. In many areas, rice is harvested in the fall, followed by wheat cultivation through the spring. As a result, people often eat wheat-based dishes as staple foods and snacks, and udon, mochi, and manju, which are made from wheat flour, are popular. Yakimochi,\" which is made from wheat flour and baked, is one of the local dishes that grew out of Gunma's flour-based food culture.

During the Edo period, when eating meat of animals was prohibited, loach was a familiar food for those who wanted to gain strength, just like carp and eel. Dojyo is written \"loach\" or \"loach,\" and in old Japanese kana usage, it is written \"dojiyau\" or \"dojiyau. Komagata Dozei\" was established in 1801 as the oldest store in Komagata, but it was originally called \"Dojiau. However, after the Great Fire of the Bunka Period in 1806, Echigoya Sukeshichi, the shop's founder, decided that four letters would be bad luck, so he changed the name to the three-letter word \"dozeyu,\" which has remained unchanged to this day. The light loach is mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce, and this is the taste that the common people of Edo enjoyed. On the other hand, \"Yanagawa nabe\" is a dish in which open loach is stewed in Warishita and simmered with egg along with chopped burdock root. There is a theory that the name \"Yanagawa\" originated from the name of a small restaurant in Nihonbashi or Asakusa Senzoku-mura in Edo (now Tokyo).

By rolling out the dough thinly enough to see through, the cooking time is reduced as it cooks quickly. Additionally, the thin texture makes it easy to eat, making it an ideal snack during work breaks.",

    "history": "Arita, Saga Prefecture, is known as the birthplace of porcelain, and porcelain production began in the early 17th century with the discovery of ceramic stone, the raw material for magnetism, at Mount Izumiyama in Arita. One of the people who found the potter's stone at this time was a Korean potter, Sanbei Kanagae (a.k.a. Sampei Lee), who is known as the creator of Arita-yaki porcelain.The \"Touzan Shrine\", built around 1658, has Emperor Ojin as its main deity, and a monument to Sampei Lee was erected on the site.On the evening of New Year's Eve, \"Arita Bowl Lantern Festival\" will be held at \"Touzan Shrine\", which is well known among the local people as the \"God of Pottery\". About 1,000 porcelain lamps are used to illuminate the area between the \"Tsuji-no-fuda\" intersection at the central intersection of the Arita Pottery Market Street and the shrine grounds. The festival begins around 23時30分 on New Year's Eve and continues until around 02時00分 on New Year's Day, when \"Yuki no Tsuyu,\" a local dish, is served. \"Yuki no Tsuyu\" is a soup of grated daikon radish roughly grated with a bamboo grater called \"Oni Oroshi,\" and baked rice cakes or thinly fried tofu in a miso soup. Since kiln workers had to stay at the kiln all night long, it is said that \"Yuki no Tsuyu\" was eaten as a nighttime meal because it warms the body even on cold nights and is easy to eat and keep one's stomach full.",

    "history": "\"Yukina no Fusubedzuke\" is a pickled dish using yukina, a snow cabbage. Yukina is one of the Yamagata-Okitama traditional vegetables, a special vegetable of the Okitama region. The name \"Fusubezuke\" comes from the dialect word \"fusuberu,\" which means \"to quickly dip in hot water\". Yukina cabbage is a rare, blanch vegetable that grows in the snow in Japan. It is said that Lord Uesugi Takayama encouraged its cultivation in order to secure fresh vegetables in snow country. It is said to have been selected and bred from a natural crossbreeding with Nagaoka cabbage introduced from Echigo. This is a vegetable that can only be produced in deep snow. It used to be called \"kabunotou\" (turnip's stem), but in 1930, the name \"yukina\" was given after improvements were made to encourage its cultivation. Currently, yukina is grown in the Kaminagai area (Sasano, Koshida, and Toyama) within Yonezawa City. The edible part of Yukina is its inner center, which grows in the snow. It is sown in late August or early September, and harvested in early November when it has grown to 60 to 80 cm in height, with the roots intact. Because yukina is susceptible to frost damage, the growers bundle 12 to 13 plants together, tie them up with straw, surround the bundle with more rice straw and soil (a process called \"tokoyose\"), and wait for the plants to be covered with snow. The temperature and humidity are maintained in the snow, and the plants nourish themselves with their own leaves and grow stalks inside. Only the inner center is used to pickle, which is about 20% to 25% of the whole amount of cabbage before being covered by the snow.",

Recently however, cultivation has become widespread, and the Murotani area of Oku-Aga town in East Niigata has become famous for Zenmai. Dried Zenmai is made from removing the fluff of the fern, boiling it, and then rubbing it by hand. The rubbing process is done over and over dozens of times over the period of two to three days. It is extremely tough work, but this helps break down the fibers and make the zenmai soft and tender. Raw zenmai is rarely used in cooking, and only what is needed of the dry zenmai is used after soaking with water. Some dishes are very simple, only using the zenmai fern, while others are bountiful and use many ingredients. During New Year’s, some people prepare boiled zenmai without cutting them, which is said to bring good luck.",

The zoni that is eaten at New Year in Kyoto is a \"Zoni made with white miso”, which includes a round rice cake, kashira-imo (parent taro), daikon (Japanese radish) and a branded Kyoto vegetable, Kintoki carrot. A round rice cake represents a wish for happiness and long life, a kashira-imo means prosperity of descendants and success in life, and a round slice of daikon means happiness, and a slice of daikon in the shape of a tortoise shell means long life. Kintoki carrot is sometimes included to ward off evil because of its vivid red color. White miso is said to have originated in Kyoto and has been made since the Heian period. A luxury product made from rice, white miso was mainly consumed by the nobility since it was valuable at the time.
